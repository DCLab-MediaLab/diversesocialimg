<photo  date_taken="2008-08-13 14:27:23" description="Close-up of the Cromwell statue during the conservation work in summer 2008. There is a striking difference – before cleaning on the left, and afterwards on the right. Erecting scaffolding around the statue of Cromwell allowed conservators to have a good look at the sculpture close up. Details included that the bible Cromwell holds in his hand is titled 'Holy Bible 1641'. The sculpture is signed 'Hamo Thornycroft 1897' on its base and the paw of the lion is dated '1899'. On the back of the statue base is written 'Founded by J W Singer and Sons Frome &amp;amp; London'. The J W Singer foundry, which was established in 1848, also cast two of the lions and the fountain in Trafalgar Square and many other public sculptures.
