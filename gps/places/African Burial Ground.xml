<photo  date_taken="2008-02-02 15:14:43" description="During the preliminary construction phase of a new Federal office building at 290 Broadway in 1991, workers discovered the remains of more than 400 Africans stacked in wooden boxes just 16 to 28 feet below street level. Construction on what was to become a $276 million U.S. General Services Commission building was halted immediately, and a subsequent archeological investigation unearthed the remnants of a five- to six-acre African burial ground used throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. Initially, the federal government resisted permanent discontinuation. owever, the overwhelming response from the African-American community, including then Mayor David Dinkins, in the form of protests, vigils, public meetings, and religious observances eventually won the support of the federal government. Enslaved Africans began arriving on the shores of the colony of New Amsterdam as early as 1626, and the area known today as New York City was one of the largest slave trading centers (second only to Charleston, South Carolina) throughout the colonial period. The Burial Ground, though, wasn't created until the early 1700s, when Trinity Church banned all Africans from its cemetery, leaving them relegated to a deserted area, then more than a mile outside the city limit, to bury their dead. As the city began to expand throughout the 18th century, it appropriated the space occupied by the African Burial Ground and covered the site with landfill and debris from the nearby leather and pottery industries. By the time slavery was abolished in New York -- on Emancipation Day, July 4, 1827 -- many had long forgotten about the burial ground. At the time of its discovery in 1991, the African Burial Ground was recognized as the largest and only known urban pre-Revolutionary African cemetery in the country. In 1993, the federal government declared the site a National Historic Landmark. Between the time of its discovery and its designation as a historic landmark, urban archeologists exhumed the remains of more than 400 African adults and children, along with various artifacts such as beads, coins, and shells, and transported them to Washington, D.C.'s Howard University. In September 2005, ground was broken for a $3 million memorial, located at Duane and Elk Streets, commemorating the lives of 20,000 enslaved Africans who were laid to rest in the Civic Center area in the 17th and 18th centuries. Though most remains were exhumed, more than 400 were ceremoniously reinterred in October 2003. Designed by architect Rodney Léon, the soaring, circular memorial is home to a wall of remembrance, ancestral pillars, a spiral processional ramp, and a &amp;quot;Circle of the Diaspora,&amp;quot; which features symbols and images of African, Latin American, and Caribbean cultures. The U.S. General Services Administrationfunded the memorial, which was built and maintained in collaboration with the National Parks Service. NPS declared the site a National Monument in fall 2007.

<photo  date_taken="2012-05-17 07:08:41" description="African Burial Ground National Monument at Duane Street and African Burial Ground Way (Elk Street) in Lower Manhattan (New York City) preserves a site containing the remains of more than 400 Africans buried during the late 17th and 18th centuries. Historians estimate there may have been 15,000-20,000 burials in what was the largest colonial-era cemetery for enslaved African people. The site's excavation and study was called &amp;quot;the most important historic urban archeological project in the United States.&amp;quot; The discovery highlighted the forgotten history of African slaves in colonial and federal New York City, who were integral to its development.

Scholars and African-American civic activists joined to publicize the importance of the site and lobby for its preservation. In 1993 the site was designated a National Historic Landmark and in 2006 a National Monument. In 2003 Congress appropriated funds for a memorial at the site and directed redesign of the federal building to allow for this. A design competition attracted more than 60 proposals for a design. The memorial was dedicated in 2007 to commemorate the role of Africans and African Americans in colonial and federal New York City, and in United States history.

<photo  date_taken="2008-02-02 15:15:03" description="During the preliminary construction phase of a new Federal office building at 290 Broadway in 1991, workers discovered the remains of more than 400 Africans stacked in wooden boxes just 16 to 28 feet below street level. Construction on what was to become a $276 million U.S. General Services Commission building was halted immediately, and a subsequent archeological investigation unearthed the remnants of a five- to six-acre African burial ground used throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. Initially, the federal government resisted permanent discontinuation. owever, the overwhelming response from the African-American community, including then Mayor David Dinkins, in the form of protests, vigils, public meetings, and religious observances eventually won the support of the federal government. Enslaved Africans began arriving on the shores of the colony of New Amsterdam as early as 1626, and the area known today as New York City was one of the largest slave trading centers (second only to Charleston, South Carolina) throughout the colonial period. The Burial Ground, though, wasn't created until the early 1700s, when Trinity Church banned all Africans from its cemetery, leaving them relegated to a deserted area, then more than a mile outside the city limit, to bury their dead. As the city began to expand throughout the 18th century, it appropriated the space occupied by the African Burial Ground and covered the site with landfill and debris from the nearby leather and pottery industries. By the time slavery was abolished in New York -- on Emancipation Day, July 4, 1827 -- many had long forgotten about the burial ground. At the time of its discovery in 1991, the African Burial Ground was recognized as the largest and only known urban pre-Revolutionary African cemetery in the country. In 1993, the federal government declared the site a National Historic Landmark. Between the time of its discovery and its designation as a historic landmark, urban archeologists exhumed the remains of more than 400 African adults and children, along with various artifacts such as beads, coins, and shells, and transported them to Washington, D.C.'s Howard University. In September 2005, ground was broken for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/2253673829/&quot;&gt;$3 million memorial&lt;/a&gt;, located at Duane and Elk Streets, commemorating the lives of 20,000 enslaved Africans who were laid to rest in the Civic Center area in the 17th and 18th centuries. Though most remains were exhumed, more than 400 were ceremoniously reinterred in October 2003.

<photo  date_taken="2006-09-21 15:03:16" description="The Supreme Courthouse (New York County Court) overlooks Foley Square and is located between Worth and Pearl Streets. The building houses the Supreme Court and the Office of the County Clerk. In 1927 the New York County Court moved from the old Tweed Courthouse to this spacious granite-faced building. The Boston architect Guy Lowell won a competition in 1913 with a design for a round building. Construction was delayed and the design altered to a hexagonal form; work finally began in 1919. The Roman classical style chosen was popular for courthouse architecture in the first decades of the 20th century. The courthouse was the first major New York commission for the well-known Boston architect Guy Lowell (1870-1927). He designed the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the building plan for Philips Academy at Andover, Massachusetts. He was also a landscape architect and designed formal gardens for Andrew Carnegie and J. Pierpont Morgan in New York. The courthouse rises above a 100-foot wide flight of steps to an imposing colonnade of 10 granite fluted Corinthian columns. Above the columns are engraved words of George Washington: &amp;quot;The true administration of justice is the firmest pillar of good government.&amp;quot; Above this is a triangular pediment, 140-feet long, with 14 classical figures in high relief. Along the huge roofline are three statues representing Law, Truth and Equity. All of the pediment sculpture was carved by Frederick Warren Allen. The monument Triumph of the Human Spirit by Lorenzo Pace is the world’s largest site-specific installation venerating the experience of African American enslavement. Towering over fifty feet and weighing more than 300 tons, the massive black granite sculpture was built near a rediscovered African burial ground. The sculpture depicts an abstract female antelope form, mounted on a boat shaped base. The piece is inspired by “Chi Wara,” an antelope effigy from West Africa that symbolizes a responsibility for continuing the next generation and for celebrating a successful harvest. Triumph of the Human Spirit serves as a monument to honor all Africans brought to America but is also dedicated to all ancestors, as well as the future generations to come. Foley Square is named for Thomas F. “Big Tom” Foley (1852-1925), a prominent Democratic Party leader from the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Foley left school at the age of thirteen to support his widowed mother, working for a period as a blacksmith’s helper. In 1877 he began his active connection with politics as a Tammany election district captain and rose to be First Assembly District leader." id="249859943" latitude="40.714435" license="3" longitude="-74.002935" nbComments="1" rank="13" tags="nyc newyorkcity manhattan foleysquare newyorkcountycourthouse courthouse court publicart triumphofhumanspirit fountain supremecourtofthestateofnewyork supremecourt downtown neoclassicism2 neoclassicism romanclassical corinthiancolumns supremecourthouse enslavement sculpture monument gothamist usccnynewyork newyorkcounty countycourthouse ny newyork" title="NYC: New York County Courthouse and Triumph of Human Spirit" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/95/249859943_d507683a5b_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="2089" />

<photo  date_taken="2006-09-21 15:01:53" description="The U.S. Courthouse was built as the Federal courthouse in New York City. Design work was started in 1933 and, after Cass Gilbert's (Woolworth Building) death the next year, supervised by his son until its completion in 1936. The six-storey base of the building is reminiscent of a Classical temple with its pilastered facades and colonnaded entrance, and rising from this is the sturdy 32-storey tower, topped by a pyramidal roof clad in gilded terra-cotta and a lantern. The monument Triumph of the Human Spirit by Lorenzo Pace is the world’s largest site-specific installation venerating the experience of African American enslavement. Towering over fifty feet and weighing more than 300 tons, the massive black granite sculpture was built near a rediscovered African burial ground. The sculpture depicts an abstract female antelope form, mounted on a boat shaped base. The piece is inspired by “Chi Wara,” an antelope effigy from West Africa that symbolizes a responsibility for continuing the next generation and for celebrating a successful harvest. Triumph of the Human Spirit serves as a monument to honor all Africans brought to America but is also dedicated to all ancestors, as well as the future generations to come. Foley Square is named for Thomas F. “Big Tom” Foley (1852-1925), a prominent Democratic Party leader from the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Foley left school at the age of thirteen to support his widowed mother, working for a period as a blacksmith’s helper. In 1877 he began his active connection with politics as a Tammany election district captain and rose to be First Assembly District leader." id="249864046" latitude="40.714435" license="3" longitude="-74.002935" nbComments="1" rank="31" tags="nyc newyorkcity manhattan foleysquare fountain publicart triumphofhumanspirit enslavement sculpture monument court courthouse federalcourthouse uscourthouse classical gothamist ny newyork" title="NYC: US Courthouse and Triumph of Human Spirit" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/90/249864046_8448edab6b_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="2522" />
