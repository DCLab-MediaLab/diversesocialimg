<photo  date_taken="2012-07-22 10:56:49" description="The famous balcony on the north wing of la Casa Rosada has hosted some of the most important evens in Argentine history. It as here that Juan Perón last appeared in public before his death in 1974, Pope John Paul II blessed the people of Argentina during la Guerra de las Islas Malvinas, Presidente Raúl Alfonsin announced the end of the military uprising of Semana Santa in 1987 (La casa está en orden y no hay sangre en Argentina. ¡Felices pascuas!) and most famously, Evita addressed her people following her husband's arrest. La Casa Rosada (The Pink House), officially known as Casa de Gobierno, is the official executive mansion and office of the Presidente de la Nación Argentina (President of the Argentine Nation). Its balcony, which faces this large square, has famously served as a podium by many figures, including Eva Perón, who rallied the descamisados there, and Pope John Paul II, who visited Buenos Aires in 1998. Located at the east end of Plaza de Mayo, the Italian-style neoclassical building was built in phases, but dates back mostly to the late 19th century. The site, originally at the shoreline of the Río de la Plata, was first occupied in 1594 by la Real Fortaleza de Don Juan Baltazar de Austria, and then its 1713 replacement, Castillo de San Miguel. In 1857, President Justo José de Urquiza largely replaced the fort with Edward Taylor's La Aduana Nueva, a new Italianate-style Custom house, but its administrative annex survived to be used as the Presidential offices of Bartolomé Mitre in the 1860s. President Domingo Sarmiento gave the building its characteristic pink hue--reportedly to defuse political tensions by mixing the red and white colors of the opposing political parties. An alternative explanation, though, suggests the original paint contained cow's blood to prevent damage from humidity. Sarmiento also commissioned Carl Kihlberg to build Casa de Correos, the Second Empire-style Central Post Office, next door in 1873.

The ceiling was painted by Italian Artist Luis de Servi in 1910 as a tribute to the May Revolution, with allegories representing 25 de Mayo and 9 de Julio.

Over the years, she became a part of international pop culture, most famously as the subject of Tim Rice's musical, Evita. Born is the village of Los Toldos in rural Argentina, she moved to Buenos Aires at the age of 15 to pursue a career in stage, radio and film. After meeting and marrying Colonel Perón, her influence grew within the pro-Peronist trade unions. She also ran the Ministries of Labor and Health, founded and ran the charitable Eva Perón Foundation, championed women's suffrage in Argentina, and founded and ran the nation's first large-scale female political party, the Female Peronist Party. In 1951, she announced her candidacy for the office of Vice President, behind the support of the worklng class descamisados or &amp;quot;shirtless ones&amp;quot;, but withdrew as a result of declining health and opposition from the nation's military and bourgeoisie.

In the right corner of the room sits a bust of General José de San Martín by Fillpino sculptor Félix Pardo de Tavera, and in the left corner, a bust of General Manuel Belgrano, by Argentine sculptor Juan Carlos Ferraro. The ceiling was painted by Italian Artist Luis de Servi in 1910 as a tribute to the May Revolution, with allegories representing 25 de Mayo and 9 de Julio. In the center of the room hangs a large 24-carat gold-plated bronze chandelier, manufactured by la Casa Azaretto Hermanos, featuring 460 light bulbs, weighing 600 pounds and standing stretching six meters high. The original English stoneware floor was replaced with the current Slavonia oak parquet flooring from Brussels in 1903. La Casa Rosada (The Pink House), officially known as Casa de Gobierno, is the official executive mansion and office of the Presidente de la Nación Argentina (President of the Argentine Nation). Its balcony, which faces this large square, has famously served as a podium by many figures, including Eva Perón, who rallied the descamisados there, and Pope John Paul II, who visited Buenos Aires in 1998. Located at the east end of Plaza de Mayo, the Italian-style neoclassical building was built in phases, but dates back mostly to the late 19th century. The site, originally at the shoreline of the Río de la Plata, was first occupied in 1594 by la Real Fortaleza de Don Juan Baltazar de Austria, and then its 1713 replacement, Castillo de San Miguel. In 1857, President Justo José de Urquiza largely replaced the fort with Edward Taylor's La Aduana Nueva, a new Italianate-style Custom house, but its administrative annex survived to be used as the Presidential offices of Bartolomé Mitre in the 1860s. President Domingo Sarmiento gave the building its characteristic pink hue--reportedly to defuse political tensions by mixing the red and white colors of the opposing political parties. An alternative explanation, though, suggests the original paint contained cow's blood to prevent damage from humidity.

After serving in several government positions, including those of Minister of Labor and Vice President of the Republic, he was three times elected as President of Argentina although he managed to serve only one full term in this function. Perón's last term as President of the Republic began in 1973 and lasted for just nine months, until his death in 1974, whereupon he was succeeded by his third wife, the Vice President of the Republic, María Estela Martínez. Perón and his second wife, Eva Duarte, were immensely popular among many Argentines. They are still considered icons by the Peronists. The Peróns' followers praised their efforts to eliminate poverty and to dignify labor, while their detractors considered them demagogues and dictators. The Peróns gave their name to the political movement known as Peronism, which in present-day Argentina is represented mainly by the Justicialist Party.

After serving in several government positions, including those of Minister of Labor and Vice President of the Republic, he was three times elected as President of Argentina although he managed to serve only one full term in this function. Perón's last term as President of the Republic began in 1973 and lasted for just nine months, until his death in 1974, whereupon he was succeeded by his third wife, the Vice President of the Republic, María Estela Martínez. Perón and his second wife, Eva Duarte, were immensely popular among many Argentines. They are still considered icons by the Peronists. The Peróns' followers praised their efforts to eliminate poverty and to dignify labor, while their detractors considered them demagogues and dictators. The Peróns gave their name to the political movement known as Peronism, which in present-day Argentina is represented mainly by the Justicialist Party. La Galería de los Patriotas Latinoamericanos, the main street level entrance from Balcarce, was originally the open passage that separated the two distinct buildings of la Casa Rosada.

<photo  date_taken="2012-07-22 10:11:11" description="Juan Pablo Duarte y Díez (1813-1876) was one of the founding fathers and liberators of the Dominican Republic. As a young man, Duarte founded a society called La Trinitaria which sought to promote democratic ideals among the Spanish-speaking inhabitants of Hispaniola Island, most of whom were clustered around the city of Santo Domingo. In 1843 Duarte launched an attempt to free the eastern half of the island from Haitian rule. When the rebellion failed, Duarte fled Hispaniola.

Together with her husband, she led an indigenous uprising against the Spanish in Bolivia at the head of an army of some 40,000 which laid siege to the city of La Paz in 1781. Katari and Sisa set up court in El Alto and their army maintained the siege for 184 days, from March to June and from August to October. Sisa was a commander of the siege, and played the crucial rule following Katari's capture in April. The siege was broken by colonial troops who advanced from Lima and Buenos Aires. Bartolina Sisa was captured and executed by the Spanish--hanged after being publicly humiliated in the Colonial Square (now Plaza Murillo), beaten and raped. Once dead, the Spanish cut her body into pieces, showed publicly her head to intimidate the natives and sent their limbs to be exhibited in different villages.

Located at the east end of Plaza de Mayo, the Italian-style neoclassical building was built in phases, but dates back mostly to the late 19th century. The site, originally at the shoreline of the Río de la Plata, was first occupied in 1594 by la Real Fortaleza de Don Juan Baltazar de Austria, and then its 1713 replacement, Castillo de San Miguel. In 1857, President Justo José de Urquiza largely replaced the fort with Edward Taylor's La Aduana Nueva, a new Italianate-style Custom house, but its administrative annex survived to be used as the Presidential offices of Bartolomé Mitre in the 1860s. President Domingo Sarmiento gave the building its characteristic pink hue--reportedly to defuse political tensions by mixing the red and white colors of the opposing political parties. An alternative explanation, though, suggests the original paint contained cow's blood to prevent damage from humidity. Sarmiento also commissioned Carl Kihlberg to build Casa de Correos, the Second Empire-style Central Post Office, next door in 1873. President Julio Roca commissioned Enrique Aberg to replace the cramped State House with one resembling the Central Post Office in 1882. In 1884, he commissioned Francesco Tamburini to unify the two with the now iconic Italianate archway. The resulting statehouse that stills stands today was completed in 1898 following an eastward expansion that included the demolition of Taylor's custom house." id="7998585744" latitude="-34.608264" license="3" longitude="-58.370637" nbComments="0" rank="80" tags="galeríadelospatriotaslatinoamericanos galleryoflatinamericanpatriots casarosada pinkhouse lacasarosada thepinkhouse casadegobierno houseofgovernment governmenthouse buenosaires ciudadautónomadebuenosaires ciudadautonomadebuenosaires southamerica monserrat argentina" title="Buenos Aires - Monserrat: Casa Rosada - La Galería de los Patriotas Latinoamericanos" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8170/7998585744_21ac01fc87_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="27" />
