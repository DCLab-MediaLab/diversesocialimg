<photo  date_taken="2008-07-08 16:04:18" description="Mr Christian Poncelet (Speaker of the French Senate) &amp;amp; the senators standing and applauding Ingrid Betancourt. These photos were taken on the 8th of July 2008 at the French Senate. Ingrid Betancourt returned to France after more than 6 years of captivity on the 4th of July 2008 - after her rescue by the Colombian Army on the 2nd of July 2008, along with 14 other political hostages held by the FARC guerrilla forces. Naturally, this was wonderful news to those fighting for the release of all the hostages held in Colombia, but there remain close to 2000 people being held in that country. I would like to believe that the actions of the ordinary citizens who fought to bring the hostages' plight to the eyes of the world; made a difference and encouraged those in positions of real power to take action. Of course, more needs to be done to bring a final and positive resolution to the crisis in Colombia. I would like to strongly encourage all those who believe in humanitarian and human rights issues (whichever they may be) to take personal action. Of course each individual has varying amounts of time and effort to afford, yet each act counts and is vital. In this world the political, financial and communitarian interests of many of those who hold real power to bring change are counter to the lives of the weakest and the oppressed in our societies - those who want to bring real change need to act together today for a better and more just world. Tomorrow shall always be too late.... N.B: The FARC have declared that they shall unilaterally release more hostages shortly - hopefully this marks the possibility for an end to the crisis." id="3238046217" latitude="48.848419" license="3" longitude="2.337191" nbComments="0" rank="1" tags="ingrid betancourt ingridbetancourt freedom colombia colombian hostage hostages hope liberté colombie otage espoir colombiano secuestrados rehénes esperanza libertà ostaggi speranza paris parigi france francia appeal protest free libre libero party fête fiesta festa joy joie alegría gioia celebration celebración celebrazione good news return retour regreso ritorno welcome bienvenue bienvenida benvenuta senate sénat senado senato chamber chambre parliament parlamento palace palais palacio palazzo luxembourg christianponcelet président speaker applause applaudissementsbetancourtingridbetancourtfreedomcolombiacolombianhostagehostageshopelibertécolombieotageespoircolombianosecuestradosrehénesesperanzalibertàostaggisperanzaparisparigifrancefranciaappealprotestfreelibreliberopa" title="&quot;Douce France....&quot;" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/3535/3238046217_2e5b1e9e90_b.jpg" username="h de c" views="185" />
<photo  date_taken="2007-09-09 11:15:52" description="The Palais du Luxembourg, now home to the French Senate, was built for Marie de de Médicis, widow of Henri IV mother of king Louis XIII of France, to remind her of her native Florence. In 1612, she bought and old hôtel particulier owned by François, duc de Luxembourg and the surrounding property and commissioned architect Salomon de Brosse to built, in the style of the Pitti Palace in Florence, what she called Palais Médicis. She installed her household in 1625, while work on interiors continued. Construction was finished in 1631, but the Queen Mother was forced from court the same year, following the Day of the Dupes. In 1624, she bequeathed the palace to her second son, Gaston d'Orléans, the king's younger brother, who passed it to his widow and daughter, Anne, Duchess of Montpensier, who made it her residence. Her daughter, the duchesse de Guise, inherited it in 1660 and gave it to Louis XIV in 1694. The palace was not used again until it was owned by Louis XVI, who gave it in 1778 to his brother, the Comte de Provence. During the French Revolution, it was briefly a prison, then the center of the French Directory and later the first residence of Napoleon Bonaparte, as First Consul of France. It has continued its senatorial role, with brief interruptions, ever since. During the German occupation of Paris (1940-1944), Hermann Göring took over the Palais as the headquarters of the Luftwaffe in France, taking for himself a sumptuous suite of rooms to accommodate his visits to the French capital. His subordinate, Luftwaffe Field Marshal Hugo Sperrle, also took an apartment and spent most of the war enjoying the luxurious surroundings. The Palais was a designated &amp;quot;strong point&amp;quot; for German forces defending the city in August 1944, but thanks to the decision of commanding Gen. Dietrich von Choltitz to surrender the city rather than fight, it was only minimally damaged and later used for the peace conference of 1946.

<photo  date_taken="2007-09-09 11:44:50" description="This statue of Marie Stuart, reine de France et d'Ecosse sits in Jardin du Luxembourg. Mary I (popularly known as Mary, Queen of Scots) was Queen of Scots (the monarch of the Kingdom of Scotland) from 1542 to 1567, and the queen consort of France from 1559 to 1560. Mary was born in Linlithgow Palace in 1542 as the only legitimate child of James V of Scotland and Mary of Guise. James who died six days after her birth leaving her as the infant queen. Through her grandmother, Margaret Tudor, she had the strongest claim to the throne of England after the children of Henry VIII. This claim, and her Roman Catholicism, made Mary a threat to Elizabeth I of England, who finally had her executed. However, Mary's son, James VI of Scotland, succeeded Elizabeth to the English throne as James I. Mary's reported beauty and charm and her undoubted courage have made her a particularly romantic figure in history.
