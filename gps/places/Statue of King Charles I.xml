Located in the center of London, the square is a public space and tourist attraction, and is also used for political demonstrations and community gatherings, such as the celebration of New Year's Eve. The name commemorates the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar, a major British naval victory during the Napoleonic Wars. The original name was to have been &amp;quot;King William the Fourth's Square,&amp;quot; but George Ledwell Taylor suggested the name &amp;quot;Trafalgar Square.&amp;quot; In the 1820s the Prince Regent hired the architect John Nash to redevelop the area, and Nash cleared the square as part of his Charing Cross Improvement Scheme. The current architecture of the square is due to Sir Charles Barry and was completed in 1845. Nelson's Column is in the center of the square, flanked by fountains designed in 1937 as replacements for two earlier fountains, and guarded by four monumental bronze lions. The column is topped by a statue of Horatio Nelson, the vice admiral who commanded the British Fleet at Trafalgar. The square has become a social and political focus for visitors and Londoners alike; its symbolic importance was demonstrated in 1940 when the Nazi SS developed secret plans to transfer Nelson's Column to Berlin following an expected German invasion Since its construction, Trafalgar Square has been a popular spot for political demonstrations, though the authorities have often attempted to ban them. The same that year Nelson's column opened, for example, the authorities started banning Chartist meetings in the square. A general ban on political rallies remained in effect until the 1880s, when the emerging Labour movement, particularly the Social Democratic Federation, began holding protests there. One of the first significant demonstrations of the modern era was held in the square in September 1961 by the Committee of 100, which included the philosopher Bertrand Russell. The protesters rallied for peace and against war and nuclear weapons. The square was also scene to a large vigil held shortly after the terrorist bombings in London on July 7, 2005. On March 27, 2011, the square was occupied by protesters using the square to rally against the UK Budget and its proposed budget cuts. During the night, the situation turned violent as the escalation by riot police and protesters damaged major portions of the square. With all of this historical background, I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I got to Trafalgar Square. But it turned out to be mostly students and tourists from various countries, wandering around peacefully, as well as various &amp;quot;locals&amp;quot; who were enjoying a sunny afternoon in the square. I took some 200 photos, and decided that 40 of them were sufficiently interesting to warrant uploading to Flickr... So that's it for Trafalgar Square. Maybe I'll come back someday, maybe I won't. Meanwhile, there are still other places to see here in London -- but they'll have to wait for my next trip. For now, it's time to head back to New York City." id="5601370583" latitude="51.507788" license="1" longitude="-0.127831" nbComments="0" rank="10" tags="londoncouplesunglassessmiling trafalgarsquare" title="Do you think we look cool enough to sit up here all afternoon?" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/5305/5601370583_c7ebc88e90_b.jpg" username="Ed Yourdon" views="195" />

<photo  date_taken="2011-03-31 03:35:24" description="(More details later, as time permits) ************************************* After photographing some of the people and scenes on Camden High Street and Piccadilly Circus (which you can see in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/yourdon/sets/72157626408568788/&quot;&gt;this Flickr set&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/yourdon/sets/72157626313204813/&quot;&gt;this Flickr set&lt;/a&gt;), I decided that my next stop should be Trafalgar Square, which you can learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Square&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Wikipedia. Located in the center of London, the square is a public space and tourist attraction, and is also used for political demonstrations and community gatherings, such as the celebration of New Year's Eve. The name commemorates the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar, a major British naval victory during the Napoleonic Wars. The original name was to have been &amp;quot;King William the Fourth's Square,&amp;quot; but George Ledwell Taylor suggested the name &amp;quot;Trafalgar Square.&amp;quot; In the 1820s the Prince Regent hired the architect John Nash to redevelop the area, and Nash cleared the square as part of his Charing Cross Improvement Scheme. The current architecture of the square is due to Sir Charles Barry and was completed in 1845. Nelson's Column is in the center of the square, flanked by fountains designed in 1937 as replacements for two earlier fountains, and guarded by four monumental bronze lions. The column is topped by a statue of Horatio Nelson, the vice admiral who commanded the British Fleet at Trafalgar. The square has become a social and political focus for visitors and Londoners alike; its symbolic importance was demonstrated in 1940 when the Nazi SS developed secret plans to transfer Nelson's Column to Berlin following an expected German invasion Since its construction, Trafalgar Square has been a popular spot for political demonstrations, though the authorities have often attempted to ban them. The same that year Nelson's column opened, for example, the authorities started banning Chartist meetings in the square. A general ban on political rallies remained in effect until the 1880s, when the emerging Labour movement, particularly the Social Democratic Federation, began holding protests there. One of the first significant demonstrations of the modern era was held in the square in September 1961 by the Committee of 100, which included the philosopher Bertrand Russell. The protesters rallied for peace and against war and nuclear weapons. The square was also scene to a large vigil held shortly after the terrorist bombings in London on July 7, 2005. On March 27, 2011, the square was occupied by protesters using the square to rally against the UK Budget and its proposed budget cuts. During the night, the situation turned violent as the escalation by riot police and protesters damaged major portions of the square. With all of this historical background, I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I got to Trafalgar Square. But it turned out to be mostly students and tourists from various countries, wandering around peacefully, as well as various &amp;quot;locals&amp;quot; who were enjoying a sunny afternoon in the square.

<photo  date_taken="2006-07-12 19:34:43" description="Charing Cross is a district of Central London, named for the hamlet of Charing, where &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England&quot;&gt;Edward I&lt;/a&gt; placed a cross in memorial to his wife, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_of_Castile&quot;&gt;Eleanor of Castile&lt;/a&gt;. It is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/08/15/charingcross_feature.shtml&quot;&gt;officially&lt;/a&gt; recognised as the centre of London; distances to London are measured to the location of the original Eleanor cross built at Charing. Charing Cross was the last of 12 locations where Eleanor's coffin rested overnight during the funeral procession from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincolnshire&quot;&gt;Lincolnshire&lt;/a&gt; to her final resting-place at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster&quot;&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, half a mile away. At each of these, Edward erected an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_cross&quot;&gt;Eleanor cross&lt;/a&gt;, of which only three now remain. The one which stands in front of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charing_Cross_railway_station&quot;&gt;Charing Cross station&lt;/a&gt; is a re-located &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era&quot;&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; copy of the original, designed by architect &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Middleton_Barry&quot;&gt;Edward Middleton Barry&lt;/a&gt;; the original was not nearly as large or ornate as the Victorian version. The cross's original location was at the village of Charing, at the top of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall&quot;&gt;Whitehall&lt;/a&gt;, at the south of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Square&quot;&gt;Trafalgar Square&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1675, the site has been occupied by Hubert Le Sueur's statue of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England&quot;&gt;Charles I&lt;/a&gt; mounted on a horse. A plaque there reads: &amp;quot;On the site now occupied by the statue of King Charles was erected the original Queen Eleanor's Cross a replica of which stands in front of Charing Cross Station. Mileages from London are measured from the site of the original cross.&amp;quot; Although it has been thought that the name Charing derived from French chère reine, &amp;quot;dear Queen&amp;quot;, it is more likely to stem from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_language&quot;&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; cearring, meaning a bend in the river — at the site of the village of Charing, coming from Westminster, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames&quot;&gt;Thames&lt;/a&gt; makes a dramatic 90-degree turn eastward. — Taken at 7:34 PM on July 12, 2006; cameraphone upload by ShoZu &lt;a href=&quot;http://loc.alize.us/#/flickr:205657417&quot;&gt;See where this picture was taken.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/groups/geotagging/discuss/72157594165549916/&quot;&gt;[?]&lt;/a&gt;" id="205657417" latitude="51.508415" license="2" longitude="-0.125356" nbComments="0" rank="21" tags="shozu nokia6680 phonecam cameraphone moblog charingcross charingcrossstation charingx strand westminster londonwc1 replica fake victorian monument london llundain geo:lat=51508415 geo:lon=0125356 geotagged schmapshortlist" title="Charing Cross replica" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/96/205657417_e2b67e7ee4_b.jpg" username="OwenBlacker" views="729" />

<photo  date_taken="2011-03-31 04:09:27" description="Note: I chose this photo, among the 30 that I uploaded to Flickr on the evening of Apr 8, 2011, as my &amp;quot;photo of the day.&amp;quot; From a technical perspective, it's okay but not fantastic.... but on a human level, it creates a story, makes an impression, and also raises a bunch of obvious questions about who these two people are, what they're doing there, what they really think of each other, etc, etc, etc. I took at least a dozen photos of them, so I have a slightly better understanding than the average person who has only this one picture to look at ... but they're still a mystery to me. I didn't know them before I arrived on the scene at Trafalgar Square, and I expect that I'll never see them again for the rest of my life. So, from the perspective of me and everyone else who sees this photo, many of the questions will forever go unanswered. But we can all make up our own stories ... and my story has to do with Sonny and Cher... ************************************* After photographing some of the people and scenes on Camden High Street and Piccadilly Circus (which you can see in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/yourdon/sets/72157626408568788/&quot;&gt;this Flickr set&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/yourdon/sets/72157626313204813/&quot;&gt;this Flickr set&lt;/a&gt;), I decided that my next stop should be Trafalgar Square, which you can learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Square&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Wikipedia. Located in the center of London, the square is a public space and tourist attraction, and is also used for political demonstrations and community gatherings, such as the celebration of New Year's Eve. The name commemorates the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar, a major British naval victory during the Napoleonic Wars. The original name was to have been &amp;quot;King William the Fourth's Square,&amp;quot; but George Ledwell Taylor suggested the name &amp;quot;Trafalgar Square.&amp;quot; In the 1820s the Prince Regent hired the architect John Nash to redevelop the area, and Nash cleared the square as part of his Charing Cross Improvement Scheme. The current architecture of the square is due to Sir Charles Barry and was completed in 1845. Nelson's Column is in the center of the square, flanked by fountains designed in 1937 as replacements for two earlier fountains, and guarded by four monumental bronze lions. The column is topped by a statue of Horatio Nelson, the vice admiral who commanded the British Fleet at Trafalgar. The square has become a social and political focus for visitors and Londoners alike; its symbolic importance was demonstrated in 1940 when the Nazi SS developed secret plans to transfer Nelson's Column to Berlin following an expected German invasion Since its construction, Trafalgar Square has been a popular spot for political demonstrations, though the authorities have often attempted to ban them. The same that year Nelson's column opened, for example, the authorities started banning Chartist meetings in the square. A general ban on political rallies remained in effect until the 1880s, when the emerging Labour movement, particularly the Social Democratic Federation, began holding protests there. One of the first significant demonstrations of the modern era was held in the square in September 1961 by the Committee of 100, which included the philosopher Bertrand Russell. The protesters rallied for peace and against war and nuclear weapons. The square was also scene to a large vigil held shortly after the terrorist bombings in London on July 7, 2005. On March 27, 2011, the square was occupied by protesters using the square to rally against the UK Budget and its proposed budget cuts. During the night, the situation turned violent as the escalation by riot police and protesters damaged major portions of the square. With all of this historical background, I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I got to Trafalgar Square. But it turned out to be mostly students and tourists from various countries, wandering around peacefully, as well as various &amp;quot;locals&amp;quot; who were enjoying a sunny afternoon in the square. I took some 200 photos, and decided that 40 of them were sufficiently interesting to warrant uploading to Flickr... So that's it for Trafalgar Square. Maybe I'll come back someday, maybe I won't. Meanwhile, there are still other places to see here in London -- but they'll have to wait for my next trip. For now, it's time to head back to New York City." id="5601432065" latitude="51.507769" license="1" longitude="-0.128058" nbComments="2" rank="37" tags="trafalgarsquare london couple together hoodie hood hat romance" title="It's like Sonny and Cher said: I got you, babe ..." url_b="http://static.flickr.com/5150/5601432065_fb26f9175a_b.jpg" username="Ed Yourdon" views="267" />
