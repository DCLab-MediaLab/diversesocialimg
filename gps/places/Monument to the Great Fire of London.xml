Another female figure by her side gently touches her with one hand and, with a winged sceptre in the other, points upwards to two goddesses sitting in the clouds, one with a cornucopia, denoting Plenty, the other having a palm branch in her left hand, signifying Peace. At her feet is a bee-hive, denoting Industry, by which the greatest difficulties can be surmounted. Beneath the figure of London, in the midst of the ruins, is a dragon supporting a shield bearing the arms of the City of London. Over her head are shown houses burning and flames breaking out through the windows. Behind Time is a group of citizens raising -their hands in encouragement. Opposite these figures is a pavement of stone raised with three or four steps, on which stands King Charles II in Roman costume, with a baton in his right hand and a laurel wreath on his head, corning towards the City of London, and commanding three of his attendants to descend to her relief. The first represents Science, with a winged head and a circle of naked boys dancing on it, and in her hand a figure of Nature with her numerous breasts ready to give assistance to all. The second is Architecture holding in the right hand a plan, and in the left, a square and compasses. The third figure is Liberty waving a cap in the air. Behind the King stands his brother, the Duke of York, holding in one hand a garland to crown the rising city, and in the other an uplifted sword for her defence.The two figures behind are justice with a coronet, and Fortitude with a reined lion. Above these figures are represented houses in building and labourers at work. Lastly, underneath the stone pavement on which the King stands, is a figure of Envy gnawing a heart and emitting contagious fumes from her envenomed mouth. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.themonument.info/history/sculpture.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.themonument.info/history/sculpture.asp&lt;/a&gt;" id="3300924252" latitude="51.510171" license="3" longitude="-0.085964" nbComments="2" rank="4" tags="themonument greatfireoflondon london architecture building chrisbeckett christopherwren cibber caiusgabrielcibber basrelief sculpture stone history charlesii allegory narrative londonist carving symbol symbolism pedestal allegorical culture build" title="Allegorical basso-relievo by Caius Gabriel Cibber: pedestal to The Monument to the Great Fire of London" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/3657/3300924252_8bd50b9036_b.jpg" username="chrisjohnbeckett" views="1163" />

<photo  date_taken="2006-11-10 06:24:46" description="The Monument to the Great Fire of London, more commonly known as The Monument is a 61-metre (202-foot) tall stone Roman doric column. It is located at the junction of Monument Street and Fish Street Hill, 61 metres from where the Great Fire of London started in 1666. It consists of a large fluted Doric column built of Portland stone topped with a gilded urn of fire, and was designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/304475945/&quot;&gt;west side of the base of the Monument displays an emblematical sculpture&lt;/a&gt;, by Caius Gabriel Cibber, in alto and bas relief, of the destruction of the City; with King Charles II, and his brother, James, the Duke of York (later James II) surrounded by Liberty, Architecture, and Science, giving directions for its restoration. Its 61-metre height marks the monument's distance to the site of Thomas Farynor, the king's baker's shop in Pudding Lane, where the fire began. At the time of construction (between 1671 and 1677) it was the tallest freestanding stone column in the world. It is possible to reach the top of the monument by climbing up the narrow winding staircase of 311 steps. A cage was added in the mid-19th century at the top of the Monument to prevent people jumping off, after six people had committed suicide between 1788 and 1842. Three sides of the base of the monument carry inscriptions in Latin. The one on the south side (pictured here) describes actions taken by Charles II following the fire. The one on the east describes how the monument was started and brought to perfection, and under which mayors. The one on the north describes how the fire started, how much damage it caused, and how the fire was extinguished. In 1681 the words &amp;quot;but Popish frenzy, which wrought such horrors, is not yet quenched&amp;quot; were added to the end of the inscription. (The west side is described above.) The inscription on the east generally blames Roman Catholics for the fire, and this prompted Alexander Pope to say, of the area that it is where, &lt;i&gt;Where London’s column, pointing at the skies, Like a tall bully, lifts the head and lies.&amp;quot; -- Moral Essays. Epistle iii. Line 339 (1733-1734). &lt;/i&gt; The words were eventually chiselled out in 1831. Wren and Hooke built the Monument to double as a scientific instrument. It has a central shaft meant for use as a zenith telescope and for use in gravity and pendulum experiments that connects to an underground laboratory for observers to work (accessible from the present-day ticket booth). A hinged lid in the urn covers the opening to the shaft. The steps in the shaft of the tower are all apparently exactly 6 inches high, allowing them to be used for accurate barometric pressure studies." id="304476448" latitude="51.510158" license="3" longitude="-0.085975" nbComments="0" rank="35" tags="uk unitedkingdom britain greatbritain londonist europe thecity monument themonument monumenttothegreatfireoflondon greatfire fireoflondon memorial london england" title="UK - London - The City: The Monument -  south Base" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/104/304476448_3babb27e45_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="619" />

<photo  date_taken="2012-02-13 22:22:42" description="On September 2, 1666, following a year of plague and a long, hot, dry summer, a fire broke out in Pudding Lane, in the heart of the city of London. It burned for three days and decimated the city. The rebuilding took an age, and in the years following Papists were blamed by the mainly Protestant populace. Meanwhile, Sir Christopher Wren (architect of the new St Pauls Cathedral, designed to replace the previous one which had perished in the flames), was commissioned to build an edifice commemerating The Great Fire of London and celebrating the reconstruction of the city. That edifice is called The Monument (I have dropped the map pin there for non-locals). It's still there today, and is definitely worth a visit. After Wren's death, an inscription blaming the Papists was added to the East Plaque on The Monument. That inscription was removed in 1830, and now lives in The Museum of London near London Wall. This is that plaque. In fact, the fire was an accident, probably caused by a hot ember falling from Thomas Faryner's unattended oven, and certainly starting in his bakery. &amp;quot;Ye Ruines&amp;quot; was pronounced &amp;quot;The Ruins&amp;quot;, much as we would say it today. No one ever said &amp;quot;ye&amp;quot; when they meant &amp;quot;the&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;ye&amp;quot; was simply English shorthand for &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; at the time. The &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot; shape is based on the Scandinavian &amp;quot;thorn&amp;quot; letter, which also has the phonetic value of &amp;quot;th&amp;quot;.

It is located at the junction of Monument Street and Fish Street Hill, 202 ft (61.57 metres) from where the Great Fire of London started in 1666. Another monument, the Golden Boy of Pye Corner marks the point near Smithfield where the fire stopped. Monument tube station is named after the monument. Since its construction (between 1671 and 1677) it has been the tallest isolated stone column in the world. The monument consists of a fluted Doric column built of Portland stone topped with a gilded urn of fire, and was designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke. Its 202 foot (61.57 metre) height marks the monument's distance to the site of Thomas Farynor, the king's baker's shop in Pudding Lane, where the fire began. The top of the monument is reached by climbing up the narrow winding staircase of 311 steps. A cage was added in the mid-19th century at the top of the Monument to prevent people jumping off, after six people had committed suicide between 1788 and 1842. &lt;a href=&quot;http://loc.alize.us/#/flickr:4045162400&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See where this picture was taken.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/groups/geotagging/discuss/72157594165549916/&quot;&gt;[?]&lt;/a&gt;" id="4045162400" latitude="51.51006" license="5" longitude="-0.085734" nbComments="0" rank="109" tags="london england monument themonument greatfireoflondon doriccolumn portlandstone christopherwren nokia nokia6700 geo:lat=5151006 geo:lon=0085734 geotagged" title="The Monument" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/3481/4045162400_d24beec785_b.jpg" username="Secret Pilgrim" views="158" />

<photo  date_taken="2006-11-10 05:57:39" description="St Helen's Bishopsgate is a conservative Evangelical church, part of the Church of England and is noted for its expository preaching. St Helen's dates from 1210 and contains many 15th and 17th century funerary monuments. It was the parish church of William Shakespeare when he lived in the area in the early 1600s. It is one of only a few City churches to survive both the Great Fire of London of 1666 and The Blitz during World War II. In 1992 and 1993, St Helen's was badly damaged by two IRA bombs that were set off nearby. The roof of the church was lifted and one of the city's largest medieval stained glass windows was shattered. Now, it has been fully restored although many of the older monuments within the church were entirely destroyed. Architect Quinlan Terry, an enthusiast of Georgian architecture, designed the restoration of the building along Reformation lines. Due to parish consolidation over the years, the parish is now named &amp;quot;St Helen Bishopsgate with St Andrew Undershaft &amp;amp; St Ethelburga Bishopsgate &amp;amp; St Martin Outwich &amp;amp; St Mary Axe.&amp;quot; In 2002, the ordained clergy of St Helen's resigned their salaries from the Church of England church commission in response to the selection of Rowan Williams as Archbishop of Canterbury and his personal views in favour of ordination of homosexuals. St Helen's withheld the amount it gave to the commission in order to pay its own clergy's stipends. In 2004 and 2005, members of St Helen's were vocal opponents of the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill on the grounds that it would ban evangelicals from discussing other religions in negative or critical terms. In a January 2005 sermon, Taylor stated that he would not be surprised if he were arrested during his lifetime for evangelical preaching." id="303484722" latitude="51.514491" license="3" longitude="-0.082134" nbComments="2" rank="127" tags="uk unitedkingdom britain greatbritain londonist europe thecity sthelensbishopsgate evangelical churchofengland sthelens sthelenbishopsgatewithstandrewundershaftstethelburgabishopsgatestmartinoutwichstmaryaxe church medieval london england" title="UK - London - The City: St. Helen's Bishopsgate" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/122/303484722_2767a45641_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="1383" />
<photo  date_taken="2006-11-10 11:14:13" description="Winchester Palace was a 13th century palace, London residence of the Bishops of Winchester. It is located in Southwark, near the medieval priory which today has become &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/303108084/&quot;&gt;Southwark Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. Southwark was the largest town in the old diocese of Winchester and the bishop was a major landowner in the area. He was also a power in the land--Winchester being the old Saxon capital--and regularly needed to be in London on royal or administrative state business. For that purpose, Henry of Blois built the palace as his comfortable and high-status London residence. The palace remained in use until the 17th century, when it was divided into tenements and warehouses, but was mostly destroyed by fire in 1814. Part of the great hall, and the west gable end with its rose window became more visible after a 19th century fire and 20th century redevelopment. It is believed that the Great Hall was built c.1220 and that the rose window was added 100 years later. The hall had a vaulted cellar below with direct access to the river wharf for bringing in wares, and was richly decorated. It often entertained royal visitors, including James I of Scotland on his wedding to Joan Beaufort (niece of the then bishop, Henry Cardinal Beaufort) in 1424. These ruins are all that remain of the palace. The visible remains were part of the Great Hall. To the right, the gable wall of the hall has doors which led t the buttery, pantry and kitchen, and displays the rose window.
