<photo  date_taken="2012-07-22 11:19:43" description="Juan Domingo Perón (1895 – 1974) was an Argentine military officer and politician. After serving in several government positions, including those of Minister of Labor and Vice President of the Republic, he was three times elected as President of Argentina although he managed to serve only one full term in this function. Perón's last term as President of the Republic began in 1973 and lasted for just nine months, until his death in 1974, whereupon he was succeeded by his third wife, the Vice President of the Republic, María Estela Martínez. Perón and his second wife, Eva Duarte, were immensely popular among many Argentines. They are still considered icons by the Peronists. The Peróns' followers praised their efforts to eliminate poverty and to dignify labor, while their detractors considered them demagogues and dictators. The Peróns gave their name to the political movement known as Peronism, which in present-day Argentina is represented mainly by the Justicialist Party. El Salón de los bustos (The Hall of Busts) opens up into Salón de Honor (Hall of Honor) on the first floor of la Casa Rosada. These rooms, accessed from Rivadavia, serve as an entrance for distinguished guests. Marble busts of the many Presidents of Argentina have dotted the checkerboarded floor since 1973. Busts are commissioned for all presidents, excluding some who took power by coup or as a national authority prior to the era of a designated presidential office, who have been out of office for at least two terms. La Casa Rosada (The Pink House), officially known as Casa de Gobierno, is the official executive mansion and office of the Presidente de la Nación Argentina (President of the Argentine Nation). Its balcony, which faces this large square, has famously served as a podium by many figures, including Eva Perón, who rallied the descamisados there, and Pope John Paul II, who visited Buenos Aires in 1998. Located at the east end of Plaza de Mayo, the Italian-style neoclassical building was built in phases, but dates back mostly to the late 19th century. The site, originally at the shoreline of the Río de la Plata, was first occupied in 1594 by la Real Fortaleza de Don Juan Baltazar de Austria, and then its 1713 replacement, Castillo de San Miguel. In 1857, President Justo José de Urquiza largely replaced the fort with Edward Taylor's La Aduana Nueva, a new Italianate-style Custom house, but its administrative annex survived to be used as the Presidential offices of Bartolomé Mitre in the 1860s. President Domingo Sarmiento gave the building its characteristic pink hue--reportedly to defuse political tensions by mixing the red and white colors of the opposing political parties. An alternative explanation, though, suggests the original paint contained cow's blood to prevent damage from humidity. Sarmiento also commissioned Carl Kihlberg to build Casa de Correos, the Second Empire-style Central Post Office, next door in 1873. President Julio Roca commissioned Enrique Aberg to replace the cramped State House with one resembling the Central Post Office in 1882. In 1884, he commissioned Francesco Tamburini to unify the two with the now iconic Italianate archway.

Juan Hipólito del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús Irigoyen Alem (1852 – 1933) was twice President of Argentina (from 1916 to 1922, and again from 1928 to 1930). His activism became the prime impetus behind the obtainment of universal (male) suffrage in Argentina in 1912. Known as “the father of the poor,” Yrigoyen presided over a rise in the standard of living of Argentina's working class together with the passage of a number of progressive social reforms, including improvements in factory conditions, regulation of working hours, compulsory pensions,and the introduction of a universally accessible public education system.

Over the years, she became a part of international pop culture, most famously as the subject of Tim Rice's musical, Evita. Born is the village of Los Toldos in rural Argentina, she moved to Buenos Aires at the age of 15 to pursue a career in stage, radio and film. After meeting and marrying Colonel Perón, her influence grew within the pro-Peronist trade unions. She also ran the Ministries of Labor and Health, founded and ran the charitable Eva Perón Foundation, championed women's suffrage in Argentina, and founded and ran the nation's first large-scale female political party, the Female Peronist Party. In 1951, she announced her candidacy for the office of Vice President, behind the support of the worklng class descamisados or &amp;quot;shirtless ones&amp;quot;, but withdrew as a result of declining health and opposition from the nation's military and bourgeoisie.

Perón's last term as President of the Republic began in 1973 and lasted for just nine months, until his death in 1974, whereupon he was succeeded by his third wife, the Vice President of the Republic, María Estela Martínez. Perón and his second wife, Eva Duarte, were immensely popular among many Argentines. They are still considered icons by the Peronists. The Peróns' followers praised their efforts to eliminate poverty and to dignify labor, while their detractors considered them demagogues and dictators. The Peróns gave their name to the political movement known as Peronism, which in present-day Argentina is represented mainly by the Justicialist Party.

However, when a new revolution succeeded in winning independence for the Dominican Republic in February 1844, Duarte was invited to return as President of the new republic.

A member of the Aymara, Apasa took the name &amp;quot;Tupac Katari&amp;quot; to honor two rebel leaders: Tomás Katari, and Túpac Amaru II. He raised an army of some 40,000 and laid siege to the city of La Paz in 1781. Katari and his wife, Bartolina Sisa set up court in El Alto and maintained the siege for 184 days, from March to June and from August to October. Sisa was a commander of the siege, and played the crucial rule following Katari's capture in April. The siege was broken by colonial troops who advanced from Lima and Buenos Aires. Katari laid siege again later in the year, this time joined by Andrés Túpac Amaru, nephew of Túpac Amaru II. But Katari was again unsuccessful. Despite his subsequent betrayal, defeat, torture, and execution (torn by his extremities into four pieces), Túpac Katari is remembered as a hero by modern indigenous movements in Bolivia, who call themselves Katarismo.

While the modern plaza took its form in 1884, its origins trace back to the early foundation of the city in 1580 when Juan de Garay planned a never built central plaza. In 1608, Jesuit clergymen secured a title to the property where Gar. In 1661 the local governor purchased the eastern half, which soon became the Plaza de Armas or Plaza del Fuerte. In 1804, the colonial government built Recova Vieja, a north-south Romanesque colonnade, which would soon become the plaza's market and created Plaza de la Victoria to the west. The area continued mostly unchanged until 1884, with only minor modifications including the addition of 1811 addition of La Pirámide de Mayo, when Mayor Torcuato de Alvear ordered the demolition of the colonnade, creating the current landscape. La Pirámide de Mayo (May Pyramid), is the oldest national monument in the City of Buenos Aires was inaugurated on May 25, 1811 in in Plaza de Mayo. Its construction was by the Primera Junta to celebrate the first anniversary of the la Revolución de Mayo. By 1856, the monument had begun to deteriorate, and, under the direction of painter and architect Prilidiano Pueyrredón, ist was reconstructed. The old monument was covered in brick and masonry and used as a foundation. A 3.6 meter tall allegorical statue of Liberty crowned with a Phrygian cap created by French sculptor Joseph Dubourdieu was added to the crown. Dubourdieu also created four other allegorical sculptures for the four corners of the pedestal. The eastern face of the obelisk was adorned with a golden sun facing Casa Rosada, and the remaining three sides were decorated with crowns of laurels in alto-relievo. The original pedestal and capital were increased in height and breadth, with each of the four sides adorned with the national arms. A new fence was constructed with a gaslight placed at each corner. From the ground to the peak of the statue's Phrygian cap, the Pyramid now measured 18.76 metres. In 1859, as the plaster began to deteriorate, the base was refaced in marble. In 1873, Dubourdieu's stucco and terracotta statues began to decay and were replaced with four marble statues from the first floor of Banco Provincia. In 1912, the marble statues were removed (and later &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/search/?ss=2&amp;amp;w=70323761@N00&amp;amp;q=josephdubordieu+plazoletadesanfrancisco&amp;amp;m=text&quot;&gt;installed in Plazoleta de San San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;) and the pyramid was moved 63 meters to the east as part of an unmaterialized plan to surround it with a larger, grander monument. Instead, the foundation was repainted, the arms were restored to their 1813 condition , and the original railing was restored.
