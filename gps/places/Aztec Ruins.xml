<photo  date_taken="2010-08-01 09:41:23" description="The Aztec Ruins National Monument preserves ancestral Pueblo structures in north-western New Mexico, United States, located close to the town of Aztec and northeast of Farmington, near the Animas River. Salmon Ruins and Heritage Park, with more ancestral Pueblo structures, lies a short distance to the south, just west of Bloomfield near the San Juan River. The buildings date back to the 11th to 13th centuries, and the misnomer attributing them to the Aztec civilization can be traced back to early American settlers in the mid-19th century. The actual construction was by the ancestral Puebloans, the Anasazi. The site was declared &amp;quot;Aztec Ruin National Monument&amp;quot; on January 24, 1923, and with a boundary change it was renamed &amp;quot;Ruins&amp;quot; on July 2, 1928. As an historical property of the National Park Service the National Monument was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Aztec Ruins was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites, as part of the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, on December 8, 1987. Anasazi settlements in North America started during the late 11th century and ran until around 1300. The Anasazi are believed to most likely have moved from these ruins into neighboring areas such as the present day Hopi and Navajo reserves and the pueblos of the Rio Grande Valley. These relocations occurred due to drought or loss of nearby fertile land. With no humans living within these, what are now ruins, their settlements slowly were covered by sand and were untouched until the mid-1800s.

<photo  date_taken="2008-01-08 13:22:02" description="The purpose of the round rooms seen in the pueblos, or kivas, is still unknown. Generally in archaeology when a function of an artifact or feature is unknown it will be attributed to ceremonial use. Such has been done with the kivas. Others think that these rooms may have had other purposes such as holding community meetings or was used as a communal storage unit for agricultural and other goods. Size may also have an impact on the structure's purpose. Smaller kivas may have been used for storage, while larger kivas may have been used for community gathering centers. One of the theories behind kivas being a communal room is that circular objects have a harder time being partitioned, especially when compared to blocked rooms that have corners and can be made into small blocked areas.

These relocations occurred due to drought or loss of nearby fertile land. With no humans living within these, what are now ruins, their settlements slowly were covered by sand and were untouched until the mid-1800s. These ruins would not receive official protection until 1923 when the national monument was established. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Ruins_National_Monument&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Ruins_National_Monument&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&lt;/a&gt;" id="4855357532" latitude="36.835032" license="5" longitude="-108.000057" nbComments="0" rank="141" tags="sanjuan newmexico aztec" title="Aztec Ruins National Monument, Aztec, New Mexico" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/4136/4855357532_a46ab94a2f_b.jpg" username="Ken Lund" views="14" />

This type seems like it would store easier and take up less space if you wanted to pull it up from where it was leaning. Most of the pueblos had two story rooms, so ladders were essential. Some rooms even had three stories. The description seen next to the ladder tells that it is around 900 years old. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology&quot;&gt;Dendrochronology&lt;/a&gt; is pretty amazing.

<photo  date_taken="2008-01-08 13:08:16" description="Unfortunately with dim lighting and a bit of space between the glass and the item on display, it was hard to get good photos of many of the artifacts.

Along with most of the woven organics, this shoe was probably made from &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/baggis/2201683661/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;yucca&lt;/a&gt; plant fibers. This is just a guess, but this one might be more useful in the winter where you can stuff fibrous material in the shoe with your foot as insulation. During the summer months a &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/baggis/2200453844/&quot;&gt;sandal&lt;/a&gt; may have been the preferred shoe." id="2197751473" latitude="36.834603" license="2" longitude="-108.000218" nbComments="0" rank="147" tags="aztecruins newmexico aztec woven shoe weave yucca weaving" title="Woven Shoe" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/2039/2197751473_81f39cd07b_b.jpg" username="Travis S." views="257" />

This case had no explanation and I took this mostly for the blowfish-looking vessel on the right. If I had to choose that these were either the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/baggis/2197753473/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;Chaco&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/baggis/2197752917/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;Mesa Verde&lt;/a&gt;-style pottery as given by their brief descriptions, I'd have to go with Mesa Verde at least for the piece on the left because it has a decorated rim and has solid designs. The container in the back may be Chacoan based on its hatched design. The piece on the right I am not willing to take a guess with. It should also be noted, however, that there are a lot of different pottery styles in the area beyond just the Chaco and Mesa Verde with probable overlap between them all so classifying may be harder than it seems.
