<photo  date_taken="2009-09-26 11:10:03" description="The Pontiac Grand Ville was the top-line luxury car in the division's full-sized line from 1971 to 1975, displacing the Bonneville which had served as Pontiac's flagship since 1957. For 1975, the Grand Ville became the Grand Ville Brougham and included a bit more standard equipment than in previous years such as power windows and carpeted trunk. This would be the final year for the Grand Ville series, and this full-sized convertible would be the division's final ragtop until 1984. Grand Ville convertibles were scarce in the years from 1971 to 1975 never topping 5000 rag tops per year during the model run. 4,519 convertibles were built for the 1975 model year, and the car sold at a base price of $5,858.

<photo  date_taken="2009-09-27 12:28:13" description="The Pontiac Grand Ville was the top-line luxury car in the division's full-sized line from 1971 to 1975, displacing the Bonneville which had served as Pontiac's flagship since 1957. For 1975, the Grand Ville became the Grand Ville Brougham and included a bit more standard equipment than in previous years such as power windows and carpeted trunk. This would be the final year for the Grand Ville series, and this full-sized convertible would be the division's final ragtop until 1984. Grand Ville convertibles were scarce in the years from 1971 to 1975 never topping 5000 rag tops per year during the model run. 4,519 convertibles were built for the 1975 model year, and the car sold at a base price of $5,858.

For the City of Springfield, there are separate sets for the Capitol Complex, Downtown (including the Old State Capitol), Neighborhoods, Parks, Illinois State Fairgrounds (and past State Fairs), and more. Photographs of Lincoln sites include the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, Lincoln Home National Historic Site, Lincoln Tomb, and so on. Also in the Lincoln &amp;quot;All About Abe&amp;quot; (Set) are a few Lincoln sites not located in Springfield. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/myoldpostcards/collections/72157624660688610/&quot;&gt; The Illinois State Fair&lt;/a&gt;: My collection of photographs of the Illinois State Fair.

<photo  date_taken="2009-09-27 12:28:39" description="The Pontiac Grand Ville was the top-line luxury car in the division's full-sized line from 1971 to 1975, displacing the Bonneville which had served as Pontiac's flagship since 1957. For 1975, the Grand Ville became the Grand Ville Brougham and included a bit more standard equipment than in previous years such as power windows and carpeted trunk. This would be the final year for the Grand Ville series, and this full-sized convertible would be the division's final ragtop until 1984. Grand Ville convertibles were scarce in the years from 1971 to 1975 never topping 5000 rag tops per year during the model run. 4,519 convertibles were built for the 1975 model year, and the car sold at a base price of $5,858.

<photo  date_taken="2009-09-27 12:27:50" description="The Pontiac Grand Ville was the top-line luxury car in the division's full-sized line from 1971 to 1975, displacing the Bonneville which had served as Pontiac's flagship since 1957. For 1975, the Grand Ville became the Grand Ville Brougham and included a bit more standard equipment than in previous years such as power windows and carpeted trunk. This would be the final year for the Grand Ville series, and this full-sized convertible would be the division's final ragtop until 1984. Grand Ville convertibles were scarce in the years from 1971 to 1975 never topping 5000 rag tops per year during the model run. 4,519 convertibles were built for the 1975 model year, and the car sold at a base price of $5,858. Photographed at the 2009 International Route 66 Mother Road Festival in Springfield, Illinois on September 25-27, 2009. **************************************************************************************************** You are invited to stay and browse through my photostream.
