<photo  date_taken="2010-04-27 16:10:36" description="The Hindu caves were constructed in the beginning of the 7th century and represents a different style of creative vision and execution skills. These temples were carved from top to down. Some were of such complexity that they required several generations of planning and coordination to complete. Cave 16, called The Kailasa or Kailasanatha Temple, is the unrivalled centerpiece of Ellora. This gargantuan structure designed to recall Mount Kailash, the abode of Lord Shiva looks like a freestanding, multi-storeyed temple complex, but it was carved out of one single rock, and covers an area double the size of Parthenon in Athens. All the carvings are done in more than one level. A two-storeyed gateway opens to reveal a U-shaped courtyard. The courtyard is edged by columned galleries three storeys high. The galleries are punctuated by huge sculpted panels, and alcoves containing enormous sculptures of a variety of deities. Originally flying bridges of living stone connected these galleries to central temple structures, but these have fallen. Within the courtyard are two structures. As is traditional in Shiva temples, an image of the sacred bull Nandi fronts the central temple housing the lingam. In Cave 16, the Nandi Mandap and main Shiva temple are each about 7 meters high, and built on two stories. The lower stories of the Nandi Mandap are both solid structures, decorated with elaborate illustrative carvings. The base of the temple has been carved to suggest that elephants are holding the structure aloft. A living rock bridge connects the Nandi Mandap to the porch of the temple. The temple itself is tall pyramidic structure reminiscent of a South Indian temple. The shrine complete with pillars, windows, inner and outer rooms, gathering halls, and an enormous lingam at its heart carved from living stone, is carved with niches, plasters, windows as well as images of deities, mithunas (erotic male and female figures) and other figures. Most of the deities at the left of the entrance are Shaivaite (followers of Lord Shiva) while on the right hand side the deities are Vaishnavaites (followers of Lord Vishnu). There are two Dhvajastambhas (pillars with the flagstaff) in the courtyard. The grand sculpture of Ravana attempting to lift Mount Kailasa, the abode of Lord Shiva, with his full might is a landmark in Indian art. The construction of this cave was a feat of human genius it entailed removal of 200,000 tonnes of rock, took 100 years to complete [Wikipedia.org]" id="4558326907" latitude="20.023889" license="5" longitude="75.179167" nbComments="0" rank="14" tags="" title="Ellora's Cave 16 Kailasanatha Temple - a feat of human genius" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/4017/4558326907_7e0cc0ef90_b.jpg" username="Jorge Lascar" views="297" />
