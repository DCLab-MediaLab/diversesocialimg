To prevent differences in shade, colour and focusing, the shutter speed, aperture, focus, ISO and White balance were kept fixed in manual mode. After an unsuccessful at stitching in GIMP, the photos were combined using gigapan sticher. Their site shows photos in flash, so easily zoomable. Although my hotel was 900 meters from the Eiffel tower, I couldn't manage to go up in my 7 day visit. After reaching Paris, I caught a bad flu. The American medicines were no match for the artillery of French bacteria. So in the 7 day period, the only real tourism I did was a 2 hour bus ride. (Resting in bed most of the time).
