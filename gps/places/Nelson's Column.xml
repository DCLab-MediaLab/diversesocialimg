The 5.5m (18ft) statue of Nelson, by H.H. Bailey stands on top of a 46 m (151 ft) granite column. The statue faces south, towards the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/300146847&quot;&gt;Palace of Westminster&lt;/a&gt; and along Pall Mall, where his ships are represented on the top of each flagpole. The top of the Corinthian column (based on one from the Temple of Mars Ultor in Rome) is decorated with bronze acanthus leaves cast from British cannons. The square pedestal is decorated with four bronze panels, cast from captured French guns, depicting Nelson's four great victories. The impressively sized reliefs on the base of the column are by Ternouth, Woodington, Watson and Carew. The enormous lions are by Landseer, and have been the subject of much criticism, though they seem appropriate enough today. The monument was designed by architect William Railton in 1838, and built by the firm Peto &amp;amp; Grissell. Railton's original 1:22-scale stone model is exhibited at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London. The sandstone statue at the top was sculpted by E.H. Baily, a member of the Royal Academy; a small bronze plaque crediting him is at the base of the statue. The four bronze panels around the pedestal were undertaken by the sculptors Musgrave Watson, John Ternouth, William F Woodington, and John Edward Carew. The entire monument was built at a cost of 47,500 pounds, or 3.5 million pounds in 2004 terms." id="299930173" latitude="51.507774" license="3" longitude="-0.127903" nbComments="0" rank="134" tags="uk unitedkingdom britain greatbritain londonist europe lion column monument trafalgarsquare london england nelsonscolumn hhbailey" title="UK - London - Trafalgar Square: Nelson's Column" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/114/299930173_4b9ba0e05a_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="780" />

The National Gallery, located on the north side of Trafalgar Square, has over 2,300 paintings, most on permanent display. The collection ranges from early works by cimabue, in the 13th-century, to 19th-century Impressionists, but its particular strengths are in Dutch, early Renaissance Italian, and 17th -century Spanish painting. The gallery has flourished to international reknown since its inception in the early 19th-century. In 1824 George IV persauded a reluctant government to buy 38 major paintings, including works by Raphael and Rembrandt, and these became the start of a national collction. The collection grew over the years as rich benefactors contributed works and money. The main gallery was designed in Neo-Classical style by William Wilkins and built in 1834-38. Wilkins beat out John Nash, who proposed the location, in a design competition in 1832 with a desire to build &amp;quot;A Temple of the Arts.&amp;quot; The building has been widely criticized by critics for an excessively long facade without bulk. This was largely unavoidable, however, because the site was set back to the north because of the protected vista of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, limited to the south because of a workhouse and barracks, and required to incorporate a public right of way through the site. Another stipulation of the design was the incorporation of the coluns of the demolished Carlton House. Nash's financial constraints led him to recycle the relief sculptures on the facade, which were originally intended for his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/298030813&quot;&gt;Marble Arch&lt;/a&gt;. The most important addition to the building in recent years has been the 1991 Sainsbury Wing, financed by the grocery chain family and designed by the leading postmodernist architect Robert Venturi, to house the collection of Renaissance paintings." id="299930740" latitude="51.507774" license="3" longitude="-0.127903" nbComments="1" rank="135" tags="uk unitedkingdom britain greatbritain londonist europe lion nationalgallery sculpture trafalgarsquare neoclassical london statue england nelsonscolumn hhbailey" title="UK - London - Trafalgar Square: Nelson's Column Lion and National Gallery" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/118/299930740_cfcaf975bd_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="2244" />

<photo  date_taken="2011-03-31 04:09:27" description="Note: I chose this photo, among the 30 that I uploaded to Flickr on the evening of Apr 8, 2011, as my &amp;quot;photo of the day.&amp;quot; From a technical perspective, it's okay but not fantastic.... but on a human level, it creates a story, makes an impression, and also raises a bunch of obvious questions about who these two people are, what they're doing there, what they really think of each other, etc, etc, etc. I took at least a dozen photos of them, so I have a slightly better understanding than the average person who has only this one picture to look at ... but they're still a mystery to me. I didn't know them before I arrived on the scene at Trafalgar Square, and I expect that I'll never see them again for the rest of my life. So, from the perspective of me and everyone else who sees this photo, many of the questions will forever go unanswered. But we can all make up our own stories ... and my story has to do with Sonny and Cher... ************************************* After photographing some of the people and scenes on Camden High Street and Piccadilly Circus (which you can see in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/yourdon/sets/72157626408568788/&quot;&gt;this Flickr set&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/yourdon/sets/72157626313204813/&quot;&gt;this Flickr set&lt;/a&gt;), I decided that my next stop should be Trafalgar Square, which you can learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Square&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Wikipedia. Located in the center of London, the square is a public space and tourist attraction, and is also used for political demonstrations and community gatherings, such as the celebration of New Year's Eve. The name commemorates the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar, a major British naval victory during the Napoleonic Wars. The original name was to have been &amp;quot;King William the Fourth's Square,&amp;quot; but George Ledwell Taylor suggested the name &amp;quot;Trafalgar Square.&amp;quot; In the 1820s the Prince Regent hired the architect John Nash to redevelop the area, and Nash cleared the square as part of his Charing Cross Improvement Scheme. The current architecture of the square is due to Sir Charles Barry and was completed in 1845. Nelson's Column is in the center of the square, flanked by fountains designed in 1937 as replacements for two earlier fountains, and guarded by four monumental bronze lions. The column is topped by a statue of Horatio Nelson, the vice admiral who commanded the British Fleet at Trafalgar. The square has become a social and political focus for visitors and Londoners alike; its symbolic importance was demonstrated in 1940 when the Nazi SS developed secret plans to transfer Nelson's Column to Berlin following an expected German invasion Since its construction, Trafalgar Square has been a popular spot for political demonstrations, though the authorities have often attempted to ban them. The same that year Nelson's column opened, for example, the authorities started banning Chartist meetings in the square. A general ban on political rallies remained in effect until the 1880s, when the emerging Labour movement, particularly the Social Democratic Federation, began holding protests there. One of the first significant demonstrations of the modern era was held in the square in September 1961 by the Committee of 100, which included the philosopher Bertrand Russell. The protesters rallied for peace and against war and nuclear weapons. The square was also scene to a large vigil held shortly after the terrorist bombings in London on July 7, 2005. On March 27, 2011, the square was occupied by protesters using the square to rally against the UK Budget and its proposed budget cuts. During the night, the situation turned violent as the escalation by riot police and protesters damaged major portions of the square. With all of this historical background, I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I got to Trafalgar Square. But it turned out to be mostly students and tourists from various countries, wandering around peacefully, as well as various &amp;quot;locals&amp;quot; who were enjoying a sunny afternoon in the square. I took some 200 photos, and decided that 40 of them were sufficiently interesting to warrant uploading to Flickr... So that's it for Trafalgar Square. Maybe I'll come back someday, maybe I won't. Meanwhile, there are still other places to see here in London -- but they'll have to wait for my next trip. For now, it's time to head back to New York City." id="5601432065" latitude="51.507769" license="1" longitude="-0.128058" nbComments="2" rank="148" tags="trafalgarsquare london couple together hoodie hood hat romance" title="It's like Sonny and Cher said: I got you, babe ..." url_b="http://static.flickr.com/5150/5601432065_fb26f9175a_b.jpg" username="Ed Yourdon" views="267" />
