The National Gallery, located on the north side of Trafalgar Square, has over 2,300 paintings, most on permanent display. The collection ranges from early works by cimabue, in the 13th-century, to 19th-century Impressionists, but its particular strengths are in Dutch, early Renaissance Italian, and 17th -century Spanish painting. The gallery has flourished to international reknown since its inception in the early 19th-century. In 1824 George IV persauded a reluctant government to buy 38 major paintings, including works by Raphael and Rembrandt, and these became the start of a national collction. The collection grew over the years as rich benefactors contributed works and money. The main gallery was designed in Neo-Classical style by William Wilkins and built in 1834-38. Wilkins beat out John Nash, who proposed the location, in a design competition in 1832 with a desire to build &amp;quot;A Temple of the Arts.&amp;quot; The building has been widely criticized by critics for an excessively long facade without bulk. This was largely unavoidable, however, because the site was set back to the north because of the protected vista of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, limited to the south because of a workhouse and barracks, and required to incorporate a public right of way through the site. Another stipulation of the design was the incorporation of the coluns of the demolished Carlton House. Nash's financial constraints led him to recycle the relief sculptures on the facade, which were originally intended for his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/298030813&quot;&gt;Marble Arch&lt;/a&gt;. The most important addition to the building in recent years has been the 1991 Sainsbury Wing, financed by the grocery chain family and designed by the leading postmodernist architect Robert Venturi, to house the collection of Renaissance paintings." id="299930740" latitude="51.507774" license="3" longitude="-0.127903" nbComments="1" rank="19" tags="uk unitedkingdom britain greatbritain londonist europe lion nationalgallery sculpture trafalgarsquare neoclassical london statue england nelsonscolumn hhbailey" title="UK - London - Trafalgar Square: Nelson's Column Lion and National Gallery" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/118/299930740_cfcaf975bd_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="2244" />

The Fourth Plinth had been empty for most of its 164 year history but is now used to rotate works from leading artists. The National Gallery, located on the north side of Trafalgar Square, has over 2,300 paintings, most on permanent display. The collection ranges from early works by cimabue, in the 13th-century, to 19th-century Impressionists, but its particular strengths are in Dutch, early Renaissance Italian, and 17th -century Spanish painting. The gallery has flourished to international reknown since its inception in the early 19th-century. In 1824 George IV persauded a reluctant government to buy 38 major paintings, including works by Raphael and Rembrandt, and these became the start of a national collction. The collection grew over the years as rich benefactors contributed works and money. The main gallery was designed in Neo-Classical style by William Wilkins and built in 1834-38. Wilkins beat out John Nash, who proposed the location, in a design competition in 1832 with a desire to build &amp;quot;A Temple of the Arts.&amp;quot; The building has been widely criticized by critics for an excessively long facade without bulk. This was largely unavoidable, however, because the site was set back to the north because of the protected vista of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, limited to the south because of a workhouse and barracks, and required to incorporate a public right of way through the site. Another stipulation of the design was the incorporation of the coluns of the demolished Carlton House. Nash's financial constraints led him to recycle the relief sculptures on the facade, which were originally intended for his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/298030813&quot;&gt;Marble Arch&lt;/a&gt;. The most important addition to the building in recent years has been the 1991 Sainsbury Wing, financed by the grocery chain family and designed by the leading postmodernist architect Robert Venturi, to house the collection of Renaissance paintings." id="299798035" latitude="51.508208" license="3" longitude="-0.128901" nbComments="0" rank="45" tags="uk unitedkingdom britain greatbritain londonist trafalgarsquare europe marcquinn sculpture statue alisonlapper alisonlapperpregnant fourthplinth plinth nationalgallery museum neoclassical artmuseum london england" title="UK - London - Trafalgar Square: National Gallery" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/113/299798035_e6b7d9982e_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="1297" />

The square is also used for political demonstrations and community gatherings, such as the celebration of New Year's Eve. The name commemorates the Battle of Trafalgar (1805), a British naval victory of the Napoleonic Wars over France. The original name was to have been &amp;quot;King William the Fourth's Square&amp;quot;, but George Ledwell Taylor suggested the name &amp;quot;Trafalgar Square&amp;quot;. In the 1820s, George IV engaged the architect John Nash to redevelop the area. Nash cleared the square as part of his Charing Cross Improvement Scheme. The present architecture of the square is due to Sir Charles Barry and was completed in 1845. Trafalgar Square is owned by the Queen in Right of the Crown, and managed by the Greater London Authority, while Westminster City Council owns the roads around the square, including the pedestrianised area of the North Terrace.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Square&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;" id="8228432062" latitude="51.508188" license="3" longitude="-0.128284" nbComments="0" rank="54" tags="trafalgar square praça relógio clock olímpico olympics london 2012 londres" title="Relógio Olímpico / Olympics Clock" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8066/8228432062_d1a5811f82_b.jpg" username="Marcio Cabral de Moura" views="8" />

Nelson's Column is in the centre of the square, surrounded by fountains designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens in 1939 (replacing two earlier fountains of Peterhead granite, now at the Wascana Centre and Confederation Park in Canada) and four huge bronze lions sculpted by Sir Edwin Landseer; the metal used is said to have been recycled from the cannon of the French fleet.
