<photo  date_taken="2011-09-02 12:24:40" description="James Earl &amp;quot;Jimmy&amp;quot; Carter, Jr. (born October 1, 1924) is an American politician who served as the 39th President of the United States (1977–1981) and was the recipient of the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize, the only U.S. President to have received the Prize after leaving office. Before he became President, Carter served as a U.S. Naval officer, was a peanut farmer, served two terms as a Georgia State Senator and one as Governor of Georgia (1971–1975). During Carter's term as President, two new cabinet-level departments were created: the Department of Energy and the Department of Education. He established a national energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter pursued the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II), and returned the Panama Canal Zone to Panama. He took office during a period of international stagflation, which persisted throughout his term. The end of his presidential tenure was marked by the 1979–1981 Iran hostage crisis, the 1979 energy crisis, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, United States boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow (the only U.S. boycott in Olympic history), and the eruption of Mount St. Helens. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_carter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_carter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&lt;/a&gt;" id="6120663652" latitude="33.749829" license="5" longitude="-84.388507" nbComments="0" rank="1" tags="" title="Monument to Jimmy Carter, Georgia State Capitol, Atlanta, Georgia" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/6061/6120663652_3b6a06892b_b.jpg" username="Ken Lund" views="3" />

Dedicated on Dec. 4, 1932, the bronze statue by Joseph S Klien is 12 feet tall. Watson was a very controversial figure and over the years many people have protested to have this statue removed. The one thing that struck me as being different about this statue compared to many I've seen is the horror sci-fi b-movie film typeface for all the words on the statue. Thomas E.

<photo  date_taken="2012-11-23 14:37:21" description="From Wikipedia: The Georgia State Capitol, in Atlanta, Georgia, in the United States, is an architecturally and historically significant building. It has been named a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is the main office building of Georgia's government. The offices of the governor, lieutenant governor, and secretary of state are on the second floor, while the General Assembly meets on the third floor from January to April. There are also visitors' galleries and a museum on the fourth floor. Like many U.S. state capitols, the Georgia State Capitol is designed to resemble the Classical architectural style of the United States Capitol, in Washington, D.C.. Completed in 1889, the building was designed by architects Willoughby J. Edbrooke and Franklin P. Burnham, of Chicago, Illinois. The building was constructed by Miles and Horne, of Toledo, Ohio. Sculptor George Crouch executed all the ornamental work on the building. The commission that oversaw the planning and construction of the building included former Confederate general Phillip Cook. The front of the capitol faces west on Washington Street. The façade features a four-story portico, with stone pediment, supported by six Corinthian columns set on large stone piers. Georgia's coat of arms, with two figures on each side, is engraved on the pediment. The Capitol's interior represents the 19th century style of its time. It was among the earliest buildings to have elevators, centralized steam heat, and combination gas and electric lights. Classical pilasters and oak paneling are used throughout the building. The floors of the interior are made of marble from Pickens County, which still produces marble products today. The open central rotunda is flanked by two wings, each with a grand staircase and three-story atrium crowned by clerestory windows. The Capitol building has undergone frequent renovations to adapt to the growth and change of government. Originally constructed from terra cotta and covered with tin, in a 1958 renovation[3] the present dome was gilded with native gold leaf from near Dahlonega in Lumpkin County, where the first American gold rush occurred during the 1830s.

<photo  date_taken="2011-09-02 12:20:58" description="Atlanta is the capital of and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Georgia, with a 2010 population of 420,003. Atlanta is the cultural and economic center of the Atlanta metropolitan area, home to 5,268,860 people and the ninth largest metropolitan area in the country. Atlanta is the county seat of Fulton County, and a small portion of the city extends eastward into DeKalb County. Atlanta was established in 1847 at the intersection of two railroad lines, and the city rose from the ashes of the Civil War to become a national center of commerce. In the decades following the Civil Rights Movement, during which the city earned a reputation as &amp;quot;too busy to hate&amp;quot; for the progressive views of its citizens and leaders, Atlanta attained international prominence. Atlanta is the primary transportation hub of the Southeastern United States via highway, railroad, and air, with Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport being the world's busiest airport since 1998. Atlanta is considered an &amp;quot;alpha(-) world city,&amp;quot; and, with a gross domestic product of US$270 billion, Atlanta’s economy ranks 15th among world cities and sixth in the nation. Although Atlanta’s economy is considered diverse, dominant sectors include logistics, professional and business services, media operations, government administration, and higher education. Geographically, Atlanta is marked by rolling hills and dense tree coverage. Revitalization of Atlanta's neighborhoods, initially spurred by the 1996 Olympics, has intensified in the 21st century, altering the city's demographics, politics, and culture. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&lt;/a&gt;" id="6120654468" latitude="33.75073" license="5" longitude="-84.388003" nbComments="0" rank="13" tags="" title="Approaching Georgia State Capitol, Atlanta, Georgia" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/6073/6120654468_3385504827_b.jpg" username="Ken Lund" views="4" />

The offices of the governor, lieutenant governor, and secretary of state are on the second floor, while the General Assembly meets on the third floor from January to April. There are also visitors' galleries and a museum on the fourth floor. The capitol site was occupied previously by the first Atlanta City Hall. In getting the state to change the capital city to rapidly-growing and industrialized Atlanta from rural Milledgeville, the city donated it to the state. The first capitol in Louisville no longer stands, while Augusta and Savannah before it never had particular capitol buildings, perhaps causing (or caused by) the alternation of those two cities as capital. The legislature also met at other places, including Macon, especially during and just after the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War. Like many U.S. state capitols, the Georgia State Capitol is designed to resemble the Classical architectural style of the United States Capitol, in Washington, D.C.. Completed in 1889, the building was designed by architects Willoughby J. Edbrooke and Franklin P. Burnham, of Chicago, Illinois. The building was constructed by Miles and Horne, of Toledo, Ohio. Sculptor George Crouch executed all the ornamental work on the building. The commission that oversaw the planning and construction of the building included former Confederate general Phillip Cook. The front of the capitol faces west on Washington Street. The façade features a four-story portico, with stone pediment, supported by six Corinthian columns set on large stone piers. Georgia's coat of arms, with two figures on each side, is engraved on the pediment. The Capitol's interior represents the 19th century style of its time. It was among the earliest buildings to have elevators, centralized steam heat, and combination gas and electric lights. Classical pilasters and oak paneling are used throughout the building. The floors of the interior are made of marble from Pickens County, which still produces marble products today. The open central rotunda is flanked by two wings, each with a grand staircase and three-story atrium crowned by clerestory windows. The Capitol building has undergone frequent renovations to adapt to the growth and change of government. Originally constructed from terra cotta and covered with tin, in a 1958 renovation the present dome was gilded with native gold leaf from near Dahlonega in Lumpkin County, where the first American gold rush occurred during the 1830s. For this reason, legislative business is often referred to as what is happening &amp;quot;under the gold dome&amp;quot; by media across the state. The statue Miss Freedom has adorned the dome since the building's opening. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_Capitol&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_Capitol&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&lt;/a&gt;" id="6120121783" latitude="33.749531" license="5" longitude="-84.388936" nbComments="0" rank="36" tags="" title="Central Presbyterian Church, Across from Georgia State Capitol, Atlanta, Georgia" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/6210/6120121783_b76af68fef_b.jpg" username="Ken Lund" views="8" />

He also served as the 53rd Governor of Georgia from 1886 to 1890. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Gordon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Gordon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&lt;/a&gt;" id="6120661568" latitude="33.750124" license="5" longitude="-84.388496" nbComments="0" rank="43" tags="" title="Monument to John Brown Gordon, Georgia State Capitol, Atlanta, Georgia" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/6076/6120661568_9f8a9d1e45_b.jpg" username="Ken Lund" views="4" />

<photo  date_taken="2011-09-02 12:28:49" description="The Georgia State Capitol, in Atlanta, Georgia, in the United States, is an architecturally and historically significant building. It has been named a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is the main office building of Georgia's government. The offices of the governor, lieutenant governor, and secretary of state are on the second floor, while the General Assembly meets on the third floor from January to April. There are also visitors' galleries and a museum on the fourth floor. The capitol site was occupied previously by the first Atlanta City Hall. In getting the state to change the capital city to rapidly-growing and industrialized Atlanta from rural Milledgeville, the city donated it to the state. The first capitol in Louisville no longer stands, while Augusta and Savannah before it never had particular capitol buildings, perhaps causing (or caused by) the alternation of those two cities as capital. The legislature also met at other places, including Macon, especially during and just after the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War. Like many U.S. state capitols, the Georgia State Capitol is designed to resemble the Classical architectural style of the United States Capitol, in Washington, D.C.. Completed in 1889, the building was designed by architects Willoughby J. Edbrooke and Franklin P. Burnham, of Chicago, Illinois. The building was constructed by Miles and Horne, of Toledo, Ohio. Sculptor George Crouch executed all the ornamental work on the building. The commission that oversaw the planning and construction of the building included former Confederate general Phillip Cook. The front of the capitol faces west on Washington Street. The façade features a four-story portico, with stone pediment, supported by six Corinthian columns set on large stone piers. Georgia's coat of arms, with two figures on each side, is engraved on the pediment. The Capitol's interior represents the 19th century style of its time. It was among the earliest buildings to have elevators, centralized steam heat, and combination gas and electric lights. Classical pilasters and oak paneling are used throughout the building. The floors of the interior are made of marble from Pickens County, which still produces marble products today. The open central rotunda is flanked by two wings, each with a grand staircase and three-story atrium crowned by clerestory windows. The Capitol building has undergone frequent renovations to adapt to the growth and change of government. Originally constructed from terra cotta and covered with tin, in a 1958 renovation the present dome was gilded with native gold leaf from near Dahlonega in Lumpkin County, where the first American gold rush occurred during the 1830s. For this reason, legislative business is often referred to as what is happening &amp;quot;under the gold dome&amp;quot; by media across the state. The statue Miss Freedom has adorned the dome since the building's opening. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_Capitol&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_Capitol&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&lt;/a&gt;" id="6120667902" latitude="33.748157" license="5" longitude="-84.387778" nbComments="0" rank="49" tags="" title="Georgia State Capitol, Atlanta, Georgia" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/6202/6120667902_ab76557b0b_b.jpg" username="Ken Lund" views="19" />
