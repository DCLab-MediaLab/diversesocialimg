<photo  date_taken="2007-09-10 06:01:10" description="Named for the cemetery originally located at the site, the Fontaine des Innocents (Fountain of the Innocents) is the last Renaissance fountain in Paris. Designed and sculpted by Jean Goujon, the fountain was created between 1546 and 1549, to celebrate Henri II's arrival. It was built into a wall at the intersection of Rue St. Denis and Rue au Fers (now Rue Berger). In 1788, it was was relocated to the center of the Square des Innocents just south of Les Halles, necessitating the addition of a fourth side, which was carried out by Augustin Pajou. Goujon sculpted Henry II’s Coat of Arms and the first letter of his name on the fountain. He also paid tribute to Catherine de Medici in the same manner. The nymphs that Goujon included on each side are typical of the Mannerist style – tall and thin. Angels and traditional putti (naked, plump little boys with wings) decorate the arch in Renaissance and Mannerist style." id="1456254220" latitude="48.860613" license="3" longitude="2.347989" nbComments="0" rank="1" tags="france europe lafontainedesinnocents fontainedesinnocents fountain fontaine renaissance jeangoujon augustinpojou squaredesinnocents mannerist paris fountainoftheinnocents" title="Paris - quartier des Halles: La fontaine des Innocents" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/1227/1456254220_bef758ba9d_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="1798" />
<photo  date_taken="2008-03-08 11:30:15" description="Human chain of hope ~ chaîne humaine. I would be very grateful if you would take a moment to read this: This series of photographs was taken on Saturday the 8th of March 2008, United Nations’ International Women’s Day &amp;amp; which in France was dedicated to Ingrid Betancourt who has been held hostage now for over six years. They were taken at the 'Fontaine des Innocents' ('The Fountain of the Innocent') in Paris, France. It has been an especially difficult past few weeks for Ingrid’s family &amp;amp; friends (especially for her two children Mélanie &amp;amp; Lorenzo). Following the release of Clara Rojas &amp;amp; Consuelo Gonzalez de Perdomo in January, four other hostages (Gloria Polanco, Luis Eladio Perez Bonilla, Jorge Eduardo Gechem &amp;amp; Orlando Beltran) were liberated by the FARC on Wednesday the 27th February 2008. News of their release was wonderful and a sign of hope for the other hostages &amp;amp; their families - that a peace process would be possible, leading to further releases - but they brought with them bad news concerning Ingrid. She is being treated very badly by her captors and is extremely ill - suffering from a recurring hepatitis B infection which, if left untreated by doctors; will undoubtedly kill her. Consuelo Gonzalez has described the conditions of captivity; the lack of hygiene in the forest where the hostages are held, the non-existence of doctors and medication. In such conditions, Ingrid has only a limited number of weeks left. President Uribe and the Colombian government have decided to turn their backs on a possible peace process by attacking the FARC and killing Raul Reyes and another senior member of the group. Reyes was negotiating with Ecuadorian, Venezuelan &amp;amp; French officials with the aim of releasing a further 19 hostages this month, including Ingrid Betancourt. These hopes have just been smashed to pieces at a moment when time is running out fast. Uribe was aware of the negotiations and in spite of international calls for the two sides to talk and come to a peaceful settlement, he decided to answer the release of hostages with bullets and arms. The only voice President Uribe listens to at the moment is that of the government of United States of America. If there are U.S. citizens reading this, I ask you to please contact your Governors, Senators and Representatives. Please try and help make a difference. I know it sounds useless and impossible, but Ingrid hasn’t got much time left. If we all try and act to make a difference, it can be done. I would like to encourage everyone, no-matter where you are, to spread the word and try to get in touch with those who have enough influence to make that difference. If you are a Senator, Representative, politician, an official or adviser, (not highly likely I know, but…), then I ask you to try for a moment and imagine this was happening to you or someone you know. Really, try to imagine for a moment that your political combat for freedom and justice resulted in you being held for years away from your family, that you were seriously ill with little time left – that your children grew to adulthood without you, fought everyday for your liberation so that the world would not forget you and that you may never see them again… imagine for one slight moment – then surely you realise that you must do all you can…. I would like to dedicate this day to Ingrid Betancourt &amp;amp; to all the courageous women such as Ingrid, the Nobel Peace Prize winners Shirin Ebadi &amp;amp; Aung San Suu Kyi, and the many other women who are fighting for Liberty &amp;amp; Justice against all odds. These women are our mothers… our sisters… our daughters… our wives… our girlfriends… our best friends.

<photo  date_taken="2008-03-08 11:02:50" description="I would be very grateful if you would take a moment to read this: This series of photographs was taken on Saturday the 8th of March 2008, United Nations’ International Women’s Day &amp;amp; which in France was dedicated to Ingrid Betancourt who has been held hostage now for over six years. They were taken at the 'Fontaine des Innocents' ('The Fountain of the Innocent') in Paris, France. It has been an especially difficult past few weeks for Ingrid’s family &amp;amp; friends (especially for her two children Mélanie &amp;amp; Lorenzo). Following the release of Clara Rojas &amp;amp; Consuelo Gonzalez de Perdomo in January, four other hostages (Gloria Polanco, Luis Eladio Perez Bonilla, Jorge Eduardo Gechem &amp;amp; Orlando Beltran) were liberated by the FARC on Wednesday the 27th February 2008. News of their release was wonderful and a sign of hope for the other hostages &amp;amp; their families - that a peace process would be possible, leading to further releases - but they brought with them bad news concerning Ingrid. She is being treated very badly by her captors and is extremely ill - suffering from a recurring hepatitis B infection which, if left untreated by doctors; will undoubtedly kill her. Consuelo Gonzalez has described the conditions of captivity; the lack of hygiene in the forest where the hostages are held, the non-existence of doctors and medication. In such conditions, Ingrid has only a limited number of weeks left. President Uribe and the Colombian government have decided to turn their backs on a possible peace process by attacking the FARC and killing Raul Reyes and another senior member of the group. Reyes was negotiating with Ecuadorian, Venezuelan &amp;amp; French officials with the aim of releasing a further 19 hostages this month, including Ingrid Betancourt. These hopes have just been smashed to pieces at a moment when time is running out fast. Uribe was aware of the negotiations and in spite of international calls for the two sides to talk and come to a peaceful settlement, he decided to answer the release of hostages with bullets and arms. The only voice President Uribe listens to at the moment is that of the government of United States of America. If there are U.S. citizens reading this, I ask you to please contact your Governors, Senators and Representatives. Please try and help make a difference. I know it sounds useless and impossible, but Ingrid hasn’t got much time left. If we all try and act to make a difference, it can be done. I would like to encourage everyone, no-matter where you are, to spread the word and try to get in touch with those who have enough influence to make that difference. If you are a Senator, Representative, politician, an official or adviser, (not highly likely I know, but…), then I ask you to try for a moment and imagine this was happening to you or someone you know. Really, try to imagine for a moment that your political combat for freedom and justice resulted in you being held for years away from your family, that you were seriously ill with little time left – that your children grew to adulthood without you, fought everyday for your liberation so that the world would not forget you and that you may never see them again… imagine for one slight moment – then surely you realise that you must do all you can…. I would like to dedicate this day to Ingrid Betancourt &amp;amp; to all the courageous women such as Ingrid, the Nobel Peace Prize winners Shirin Ebadi &amp;amp; Aung San Suu Kyi, and the many other women who are fighting for Liberty &amp;amp; Justice against all odds. These women are our mothers… our sisters… our daughters… our wives… our girlfriends… our best friends.

<photo  date_taken="2008-03-08 11:06:44" description="Fabrice Delloye (Ingrid Betancourt's ex-husband). I would be very grateful if you would take a moment to read this: This series of photographs was taken on Saturday the 8th of March 2008, United Nations’ International Women’s Day &amp;amp; which in France was dedicated to Ingrid Betancourt who has been held hostage now for over six years. They were taken at the 'Fontaine des Innocents' ('The Fountain of the Innocent') in Paris, France. It has been an especially difficult past few weeks for Ingrid’s family &amp;amp; friends (especially for her two children Mélanie &amp;amp; Lorenzo). Following the release of Clara Rojas &amp;amp; Consuelo Gonzalez de Perdomo in January, four other hostages (Gloria Polanco, Luis Eladio Perez Bonilla, Jorge Eduardo Gechem &amp;amp; Orlando Beltran) were liberated by the FARC on Wednesday the 27th February 2008. News of their release was wonderful and a sign of hope for the other hostages &amp;amp; their families - that a peace process would be possible, leading to further releases - but they brought with them bad news concerning Ingrid. She is being treated very badly by her captors and is extremely ill - suffering from a recurring hepatitis B infection which, if left untreated by doctors; will undoubtedly kill her. Consuelo Gonzalez has described the conditions of captivity; the lack of hygiene in the forest where the hostages are held, the non-existence of doctors and medication. In such conditions, Ingrid has only a limited number of weeks left. President Uribe and the Colombian government have decided to turn their backs on a possible peace process by attacking the FARC and killing Raul Reyes and another senior member of the group. Reyes was negotiating with Ecuadorian, Venezuelan &amp;amp; French officials with the aim of releasing a further 19 hostages this month, including Ingrid Betancourt. These hopes have just been smashed to pieces at a moment when time is running out fast. Uribe was aware of the negotiations and in spite of international calls for the two sides to talk and come to a peaceful settlement, he decided to answer the release of hostages with bullets and arms. The only voice President Uribe listens to at the moment is that of the government of United States of America. If there are U.S. citizens reading this, I ask you to please contact your Governors, Senators and Representatives. Please try and help make a difference. I know it sounds useless and impossible, but Ingrid hasn’t got much time left. If we all try and act to make a difference, it can be done. I would like to encourage everyone, no-matter where you are, to spread the word and try to get in touch with those who have enough influence to make that difference. If you are a Senator, Representative, politician, an official or adviser, (not highly likely I know, but…), then I ask you to try for a moment and imagine this was happening to you or someone you know. Really, try to imagine for a moment that your political combat for freedom and justice resulted in you being held for years away from your family, that you were seriously ill with little time left – that your children grew to adulthood without you, fought everyday for your liberation so that the world would not forget you and that you may never see them again… imagine for one slight moment – then surely you realise that you must do all you can…. I would like to dedicate this day to Ingrid Betancourt &amp;amp; to all the courageous women such as Ingrid, the Nobel Peace Prize winners Shirin Ebadi &amp;amp; Aung San Suu Kyi, and the many other women who are fighting for Liberty &amp;amp; Justice against all odds. These women are our mothers… our sisters… our daughters… our wives… our girlfriends… our best friends.

<photo  date_taken="2008-03-08 11:10:14" description="Fabrice Delloye (Ingrid Betancourt's ex-husband). I would be very grateful if you would take a moment to read this: This series of photographs was taken on Saturday the 8th of March 2008, United Nations’ International Women’s Day &amp;amp; which in France was dedicated to Ingrid Betancourt who has been held hostage now for over six years. They were taken at the 'Fontaine des Innocents' ('The Fountain of the Innocent') in Paris, France. It has been an especially difficult past few weeks for Ingrid’s family &amp;amp; friends (especially for her two children Mélanie &amp;amp; Lorenzo). Following the release of Clara Rojas &amp;amp; Consuelo Gonzalez de Perdomo in January, four other hostages (Gloria Polanco, Luis Eladio Perez Bonilla, Jorge Eduardo Gechem &amp;amp; Orlando Beltran) were liberated by the FARC on Wednesday the 27th February 2008. News of their release was wonderful and a sign of hope for the other hostages &amp;amp; their families - that a peace process would be possible, leading to further releases - but they brought with them bad news concerning Ingrid. She is being treated very badly by her captors and is extremely ill - suffering from a recurring hepatitis B infection which, if left untreated by doctors; will undoubtedly kill her. Consuelo Gonzalez has described the conditions of captivity; the lack of hygiene in the forest where the hostages are held, the non-existence of doctors and medication. In such conditions, Ingrid has only a limited number of weeks left. President Uribe and the Colombian government have decided to turn their backs on a possible peace process by attacking the FARC and killing Raul Reyes and another senior member of the group. Reyes was negotiating with Ecuadorian, Venezuelan &amp;amp; French officials with the aim of releasing a further 19 hostages this month, including Ingrid Betancourt. These hopes have just been smashed to pieces at a moment when time is running out fast. Uribe was aware of the negotiations and in spite of international calls for the two sides to talk and come to a peaceful settlement, he decided to answer the release of hostages with bullets and arms. The only voice President Uribe listens to at the moment is that of the government of United States of America. If there are U.S. citizens reading this, I ask you to please contact your Governors, Senators and Representatives. Please try and help make a difference. I know it sounds useless and impossible, but Ingrid hasn’t got much time left. If we all try and act to make a difference, it can be done. I would like to encourage everyone, no-matter where you are, to spread the word and try to get in touch with those who have enough influence to make that difference. If you are a Senator, Representative, politician, an official or adviser, (not highly likely I know, but…), then I ask you to try for a moment and imagine this was happening to you or someone you know. Really, try to imagine for a moment that your political combat for freedom and justice resulted in you being held for years away from your family, that you were seriously ill with little time left – that your children grew to adulthood without you, fought everyday for your liberation so that the world would not forget you and that you may never see them again… imagine for one slight moment – then surely you realise that you must do all you can…. I would like to dedicate this day to Ingrid Betancourt &amp;amp; to all the courageous women such as Ingrid, the Nobel Peace Prize winners Shirin Ebadi &amp;amp; Aung San Suu Kyi, and the many other women who are fighting for Liberty &amp;amp; Justice against all odds. These women are our mothers… our sisters… our daughters… our wives… our girlfriends… our best friends.

<photo  date_taken="2008-03-08 10:58:49" description="I would be very grateful if you would take a moment to read this: This series of photographs was taken on Saturday the 8th of March 2008, United Nations’ International Women’s Day &amp;amp; which in France was dedicated to Ingrid Betancourt who has been held hostage now for over six years. They were taken at the 'Fontaine des Innocents' ('The Fountain of the Innocent') in Paris, France. It has been an especially difficult past few weeks for Ingrid’s family &amp;amp; friends (especially for her two children Mélanie &amp;amp; Lorenzo). Following the release of Clara Rojas &amp;amp; Consuelo Gonzalez de Perdomo in January, four other hostages (Gloria Polanco, Luis Eladio Perez Bonilla, Jorge Eduardo Gechem &amp;amp; Orlando Beltran) were liberated by the FARC on Wednesday the 27th February 2008. News of their release was wonderful and a sign of hope for the other hostages &amp;amp; their families - that a peace process would be possible, leading to further releases - but they brought with them bad news concerning Ingrid. She is being treated very badly by her captors and is extremely ill - suffering from a recurring hepatitis B infection which, if left untreated by doctors; will undoubtedly kill her. Consuelo Gonzalez has described the conditions of captivity; the lack of hygiene in the forest where the hostages are held, the non-existence of doctors and medication. In such conditions, Ingrid has only a limited number of weeks left. President Uribe and the Colombian government have decided to turn their backs on a possible peace process by attacking the FARC and killing Raul Reyes and another senior member of the group. Reyes was negotiating with Ecuadorian, Venezuelan &amp;amp; French officials with the aim of releasing a further 19 hostages this month, including Ingrid Betancourt. These hopes have just been smashed to pieces at a moment when time is running out fast. Uribe was aware of the negotiations and in spite of international calls for the two sides to talk and come to a peaceful settlement, he decided to answer the release of hostages with bullets and arms. The only voice President Uribe listens to at the moment is that of the government of United States of America. If there are U.S. citizens reading this, I ask you to please contact your Governors, Senators and Representatives. Please try and help make a difference. I know it sounds useless and impossible, but Ingrid hasn’t got much time left. If we all try and act to make a difference, it can be done. I would like to encourage everyone, no-matter where you are, to spread the word and try to get in touch with those who have enough influence to make that difference. If you are a Senator, Representative, politician, an official or adviser, (not highly likely I know, but…), then I ask you to try for a moment and imagine this was happening to you or someone you know. Really, try to imagine for a moment that your political combat for freedom and justice resulted in you being held for years away from your family, that you were seriously ill with little time left – that your children grew to adulthood without you, fought everyday for your liberation so that the world would not forget you and that you may never see them again… imagine for one slight moment – then surely you realise that you must do all you can…. I would like to dedicate this day to Ingrid Betancourt &amp;amp; to all the courageous women such as Ingrid, the Nobel Peace Prize winners Shirin Ebadi &amp;amp; Aung San Suu Kyi, and the many other women who are fighting for Liberty &amp;amp; Justice against all odds. These women are our mothers… our sisters… our daughters… our wives… our girlfriends… our best friends.

<photo  date_taken="2008-03-08 10:44:06" description="I would be very grateful if you would take a moment to read this: This series of photographs was taken on Saturday the 8th of March 2008, United Nations’ International Women’s Day &amp;amp; which in France was dedicated to Ingrid Betancourt who has been held hostage now for over six years. They were taken at the 'Fontaine des Innocents' ('The Fountain of the Innocent') in Paris, France. It has been an especially difficult past few weeks for Ingrid’s family &amp;amp; friends (especially for her two children Mélanie &amp;amp; Lorenzo). Following the release of Clara Rojas &amp;amp; Consuelo Gonzalez de Perdomo in January, four other hostages (Gloria Polanco, Luis Eladio Perez Bonilla, Jorge Eduardo Gechem &amp;amp; Orlando Beltran) were liberated by the FARC on Wednesday the 27th February 2008. News of their release was wonderful and a sign of hope for the other hostages &amp;amp; their families - that a peace process would be possible, leading to further releases - but they brought with them bad news concerning Ingrid. She is being treated very badly by her captors and is extremely ill - suffering from a recurring hepatitis B infection which, if left untreated by doctors; will undoubtedly kill her. Consuelo Gonzalez has described the conditions of captivity; the lack of hygiene in the forest where the hostages are held, the non-existence of doctors and medication. In such conditions, Ingrid has only a limited number of weeks left. President Uribe and the Colombian government have decided to turn their backs on a possible peace process by attacking the FARC and killing Raul Reyes and another senior member of the group. Reyes was negotiating with Ecuadorian, Venezuelan &amp;amp; French officials with the aim of releasing a further 19 hostages this month, including Ingrid Betancourt. These hopes have just been smashed to pieces at a moment when time is running out fast. Uribe was aware of the negotiations and in spite of international calls for the two sides to talk and come to a peaceful settlement, he decided to answer the release of hostages with bullets and arms. The only voice President Uribe listens to at the moment is that of the government of United States of America. If there are U.S. citizens reading this, I ask you to please contact your Governors, Senators and Representatives. Please try and help make a difference. I know it sounds useless and impossible, but Ingrid hasn’t got much time left. If we all try and act to make a difference, it can be done. I would like to encourage everyone, no-matter where you are, to spread the word and try to get in touch with those who have enough influence to make that difference. If you are a Senator, Representative, politician, an official or adviser, (not highly likely I know, but…), then I ask you to try for a moment and imagine this was happening to you or someone you know. Really, try to imagine for a moment that your political combat for freedom and justice resulted in you being held for years away from your family, that you were seriously ill with little time left – that your children grew to adulthood without you, fought everyday for your liberation so that the world would not forget you and that you may never see them again… imagine for one slight moment – then surely you realise that you must do all you can…. I would like to dedicate this day to Ingrid Betancourt &amp;amp; to all the courageous women such as Ingrid, the Nobel Peace Prize winners Shirin Ebadi &amp;amp; Aung San Suu Kyi, and the many other women who are fighting for Liberty &amp;amp; Justice against all odds. These women are our mothers… our sisters… our daughters… our wives… our girlfriends… our best friends.
