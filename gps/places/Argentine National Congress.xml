Situated at the end of Avenida de Mayo, at the other end of which is located the Casa Rosada, Argentina's parliament is bicameral and is made up of the 72-seat Senate and the 257-seat Chamber of Deputies. Designed by the Italian architect Vittorio Meano and completed by Argentine architect Julio Dormal, the building was under construction between 1898 and 1906. Inaugurated that year, its aesthetic details were not completed until 1946. Local sculptor Lola Mora graced the interior halls and exterior alike with numerous allegorical bronzes. As time went by, the building proved too small for its purpose, and in 1974 the construction of the Annex, which now holds the Deputies' offices, was started (image, below) [Wikipedia.org]" id="4729523294" latitude="-34.609653" license="5" longitude="-58.392581" nbComments="1" rank="1" tags="" title="Argentine National Congress building" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/1162/4729523294_d8c4f4bd4d_b.jpg" username="Jorge Lascar" views="143" />
<photo  date_taken="2012-12-06 00:00:00" description="Argentina's Congressional building is an impressive sight, all the more so because, unlike most parliaments, it is not set back from the streets of its capital by lawns or an exclusion zone. It both brushes shoulders with, and towers over, the people it governs. In my experience of them, monumental buildings are rather inside-out creations: whereas the primary purpose of most buildings is to shelter the people inside them, the primary purpose of monumental buildings seems to be to physically communicate a message to the people outside them. I like to think that the message intended by the builders of Argentina's Congress is that there should be as little distance as possible between the governors and the governed. Then again, they might just have been short on space! I was at the Congress in my role as COO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gopacnetwork.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GOPAC&lt;/a&gt;, to speak at a Latin American Anti-Corruption Summit." id="8255079244" latitude="-34.609749" license="3" longitude="-58.392612" nbComments="0" rank="2" tags="parliament congress senate argentina buenosaires" title="Argentine National Congress" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8218/8255079244_199dbed861_b.jpg" username="AkaashMaharaj" views="105" />

It is also used as a personal residence by some of the worker-owners. Inaugurated in 1978, the four-star establishment received generous government subsidies in anticipation of the 1978 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Buenos Aires that June. The original owner, Marcelo Iurcovich, received 37 million USD for its development in 1976 from the Banco Nacional de Desarollo (BANADE), a state-owned business lender later absorbed into the Banco de la Nación Argentina. Tourism in Argentina subsequently suffered from the effects of the military dictatorship's Dirty War and the collapse of its economic policies, however. The hotel's finances worsened further after the opening of a number of newer, competing hotels in the 1990s, and during the crisis that developed in the early 2000s. In the wake of the December riots in 2001, and after systematic firings, the Hotel Bauen was closed on December 28. In March 2003, with the help of the Movimiento Nacional de Empresas Recuperadas (National Movement of Recovered Businesses, MNER), the hotel's former employees occupied the building. While fighting for ownership through activism and negotiation, they began repairs to the building and slowly re-opened business. Since then, the Bauen cooperative has gained 150 workers, inaugurated a streetfront café (whose tile floors come from FaSinPat, a worker-controlled ceramics factory) and equipped more than 200 hotel rooms. Today the Hotel Bauen boasts rising profits, and is a center of cultural and political activity in Buenos Aires. However, the long term legality of the worker's ownership and operation is ambiguous. On October 21, 2005, the hotel was informed that, while a legal right of former employees to keep residence in the hotel was recognized, they were not permitted to function as a business. Upon delivery of this notice, entrances were closed off with official tape, but this tape was quickly removed by hotel workers, and business operations continue today. In May 2006, Judge Carla Cavaliere officially approved the suspension of the closure order. Workers can now move freely and legally in and out of the hotel. What remains to be determined is who is to be considered the official owner of the hotel. A bill of expropriation, the Ley Nacional de Expropiación, which would definitively entitle the Bauen workers to ownership of the hotel, has already been drafted and is being considered at the municipal and federal levels. Sponsored by Deputy Victoria Donda in the National Congress, the bill is being opposed by the original owners, led by Marcelo Iurcovich, and supported by the Bauen Cooperative, who are circulating a petition in support of the bill. In June 2009, the hotel served as the Proyecto Sur party headquarters during the legislative election.

In 1915 Cayetano Brenna, a famous confectioner, commissioned the Italian architect Francisco Gianotti, to design the building that would house the café on its ground floor. When finished in 1917 the building, which was on the site of an existing café, was one of the highest buildings in the city with a corner turret illuminated from the inside with electric lighting, and featuring stained glass windows and decorative windmill sails. El Molino and Galería Güemes were two of Gianotti's greatest works and represent important examples of Art Nouveau style architecture in Buenos Aires. Over the years El Molino became a favourite meeting place for local cultural, business and political figures. The café was closed on February 23, 1997, however, and today is only rarely opened to the public for events designed to advertise the urgent need to restore the building, prior further disintegration.
