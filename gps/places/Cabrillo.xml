<photo  date_taken="2013-01-26 17:21:08" description="The Old Point Loma Lighthouse - Illuminating the Past The Old Point Loma Lighthouse stood watch over the entrance to San Diego Bay for 36 years. At dusk on November 15, 1855, the light keeper climbed the winding stairs and lit the light for the first time. What seemed to be a good location 422 feet above sea level, however, had a serious flaw. Fog and low clouds often obscured the light. On March 23, 1891, the light was extinguished and the keeper moved to a new lighthouse location closer to the water at the tip of the Point. Today, the Old Point Loma Lighthouse still stands watch over San Diego, sentinel to a vanished past. The National Park Service has refurbished the interior to its historic 1880s appearance - a reminder of a bygone era. Ranger-led talks, displays, and brochures are available to explain the lighthouse’s interesting past. Construction - Why is it the &amp;quot;Old Point Loma Lighthouse?&amp;quot; The Old Point Loma Lighthouse is a reminder of simpler times - of sailing ships and oil lamps and the men and women whom day after day faithfully tended the coastal lights that guided mariners. In 1851, a year after California entered the Union, the U.S. Coastal Survey selected the heights of Point Loma for the location of a navigational aid. The crest seemed like the right location: it stood 422 feet above sea level, overlooking the bay and the ocean, and a lighthouse there could serve as both a harbor light and a coastal beacon. Construction began three years later. Workers carved sandstone from the hillside for walls and salvaged floor tiles from the ruins of an old Spanish fort. A rolled tin roof, a brick tower, and an iron and brass housing for the light topped the squat, thick-walled building. By late summer 1854, the work was done. More than a year passed before the lighting apparatus - a five foot tall 3rd order Fresnel lens, the best available technology - arrived from France and was installed. At dusk on November 15, 1855, the keeper climbed the winding stairs and lit the oil lamp for the first time. In clear weather its light was visible at sea for 25 miles. For the next 36 years, except on foggy nights, it welcomed sailors to San Diego harbor. The light had only a short life because the seemingly good location concealed a serious flaw: fog and low clouds often obscured the beam. On March 23, 1891, the keeper extinguished the lamp for the last time. Boarding up the lighthouse, he moved his family and belongings into a new light station at the bottom of the hill. Today you can see the &amp;quot;New&amp;quot; Point Loma Lighthouse from the Whale Overlook, 100 yards south of the Old Point Loma Lighthouse. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/cabr/historyculture/old-point-loma-lighthouse.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.nps.gov/cabr/historyculture/old-point-loma-lighthouse...&lt;/a&gt;" id="8419578516" latitude="32.672161" license="1" longitude="-117.240545" nbComments="0" rank="11" tags="sandiego california pointloma cabrillonationalmonument lighthouse oldpointlomalighthouse fog foggy" title="The Old Point Loma Lighthouse" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8184/8419578516_f8fc9d84f9_b.jpg" username="slworking2" views="31" />

Today, the Old Point Loma Lighthouse still stands watch over San Diego, sentinel to a vanished past. The National Park Service has refurbished the interior to its historic 1880s appearance - a reminder of a bygone era. Ranger-led talks, displays, and brochures are available to explain the lighthouse’s interesting past. Construction - Why is it the &amp;quot;Old Point Loma Lighthouse?&amp;quot; The Old Point Loma Lighthouse is a reminder of simpler times - of sailing ships and oil lamps and the men and women whom day after day faithfully tended the coastal lights that guided mariners. In 1851, a year after California entered the Union, the U.S. Coastal Survey selected the heights of Point Loma for the location of a navigational aid. The crest seemed like the right location: it stood 422 feet above sea level, overlooking the bay and the ocean, and a lighthouse there could serve as both a harbor light and a coastal beacon. Construction began three years later. Workers carved sandstone from the hillside for walls and salvaged floor tiles from the ruins of an old Spanish fort. A rolled tin roof, a brick tower, and an iron and brass housing for the light topped the squat, thick-walled building. By late summer 1854, the work was done. More than a year passed before the lighting apparatus - a five foot tall 3rd order Fresnel lens, the best available technology - arrived from France and was installed. At dusk on November 15, 1855, the keeper climbed the winding stairs and lit the oil lamp for the first time. In clear weather its light was visible at sea for 25 miles. For the next 36 years, except on foggy nights, it welcomed sailors to San Diego harbor. The light had only a short life because the seemingly good location concealed a serious flaw: fog and low clouds often obscured the beam. On March 23, 1891, the keeper extinguished the lamp for the last time. Boarding up the lighthouse, he moved his family and belongings into a new light station at the bottom of the hill. Today you can see the &amp;quot;New&amp;quot; Point Loma Lighthouse from the Whale Overlook, 100 yards south of the Old Point Loma Lighthouse. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/cabr/historyculture/old-point-loma-lighthouse.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.nps.gov/cabr/historyculture/old-point-loma-lighthouse...&lt;/a&gt;" id="8418479679" latitude="32.672019" license="1" longitude="-117.240742" nbComments="6" rank="18" tags="sandiego california pointloma cabrillonationalmonument lighthouse oldpointlomalighthouse fog foggy" title="The Old Point Loma Lighthouse at nighttime" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8500/8418479679_92d6f34649_b.jpg" username="slworking2" views="77" />

The highly urbanized land adjacent to the bay includes the city of San Diego (eighth largest city in the United States) and four other cities, including National City, Chula Vista, Imperial Beach and Coronado. Considered to be one of the best natural harbors on the west coast of North America, it was colonized by Spain beginning in 1769. Later it served as base headquarters of major ships of the United States Navy in the Pacific until just before the United States entered World War II, when the newly organized United States Pacific Fleet primary base was transferred to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. However, San Diego Bay remains as a home port of major assets, including several aircraft carriers, of the United States Pacific Fleet, and as a result of base closures beginning in the 1980s, facilities in San Diego Bay are the only remaining major naval base facilities still in operation in the entire State of California. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Harbor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Harbor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&lt;/a&gt;" id="5143866277" latitude="32.674909" license="5" longitude="-117.239527" nbComments="0" rank="100" tags="pointloma sandiego california cabrillonationalmonument cabrillo" title="San Diego Bay from Cabrillo National Monument, Point Loma, San Diego, California (24)" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/4058/5143866277_935d7e60d3_b.jpg" username="Ken Lund" views="23" />

The bay, which is 12 miles (19 km) long and 1 to 3 miles (1.6 to 4.8 km) wide, is the third largest of the three large, protected natural bays on California's entire 840 miles (1,350 km) long coastline after San Francisco Bay and Humboldt Bay. The highly urbanized land adjacent to the bay includes the city of San Diego (eighth largest city in the United States) and four other cities, including National City, Chula Vista, Imperial Beach and Coronado. Considered to be one of the best natural harbors on the west coast of North America, it was colonized by Spain beginning in 1769. Later it served as base headquarters of major ships of the United States Navy in the Pacific until just before the United States entered World War II, when the newly organized United States Pacific Fleet primary base was transferred to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. However, San Diego Bay remains as a home port of major assets, including several aircraft carriers, of the United States Pacific Fleet, and as a result of base closures beginning in the 1980s, facilities in San Diego Bay are the only remaining major naval base facilities still in operation in the entire State of California. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Harbor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Harbor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&lt;/a&gt;" id="5144468426" latitude="32.674909" license="5" longitude="-117.239527" nbComments="0" rank="117" tags="pointloma sandiego california cabrillonationalmonument cabrillo" title="Map of San Diego Bay, Cabrillo National Monument, Point Loma, San Diego, California (16)" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/1329/5144468426_7d1c732992_b.jpg" username="Ken Lund" views="28" />

<photo  date_taken="2010-10-30 13:56:41" description="The original Point Loma Lighthouse is a historic lighthouse located on the Point Loma peninsula at the mouth of San Diego Bay in San Diego, California. It is situated in the Cabrillo National Monument. It is no longer in operation as a lighthouse but is open to the public as a museum. It is sometimes erroneously called the &amp;quot;Old Spanish Lighthouse,&amp;quot; but in fact it was not built during San Diego's Spanish or Mexican eras; it was built in 1855 by the United States government after California's admission as a state. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Point_Loma_Lighthouse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Point_Loma_Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&lt;/a&gt;" id="5143881661" latitude="32.67164" license="5" longitude="-117.240611" nbComments="0" rank="150" tags="pointloma sandiego california cabrillonationalmonument cabrillo" title="Old Point Loma Light, Cabrillo National Monument, Point Loma, San Diego, California" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/1342/5143881661_cb7752c2c0_b.jpg" username="Ken Lund" views="38" />
