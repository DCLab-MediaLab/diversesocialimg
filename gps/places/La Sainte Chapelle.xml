A personal undertaking of King Louis IX, it was built to house the relics of Christ's passion, notably the Crown of Thorns, Image of Edessa and a piece of the True Cross. Louis IX purchased the crown and other relics from Emperor Baldwin II in 1939 for the exorbitant sum of 135,000 livres. He added further relics from the Byzantium in 1941 and 1943. By contrast, the entire chapel cost 40,000 livres. A masterpiece of the rayonnate period of Gothic architecture, Sainte-Chapelle is not directly credited to any designer-builder. However, Louis IX's architect, Pierre de Montereau (or Pierre de Montreuil), who had rebuilt the apse of the Royal Abbey of Saint-Denis and completed the façade of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, is usually attributed to its design. Perceived as a symbol of monarchy and religion, the Sainte-Chapelle suffered considerable damage as a result of the French Revolution. The steeple and baldachin were removed, the holy relics were scattered, and various reliquaries, including the grande châsse, were melted down. Most of the statues were saved by Alexandre Lenoir. Under the auspices of Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc, significant restoration work was undertaken by the architects Félix Duban from 1836-1848, Jean Baptiste Lassus from 1848 to 1857, and Emile Boeswillwald, from 1858 to 1868. While some of the relics were never to be found again, others are today kept in the treasure of Notre-Dame Cathedral and at the National Library. The Royal Chapel, or Upper Chapel, for the king's use and the display of the relics, was dedicated by the papal legate and connected to the aula, or the main council room. It rests upon a Lower Chapel which was served as parish church for all the inhabitants of the palace and dedicated to the Virgin Mary by the Archbishop of Bourges. The Lower Chapel is located underneath a porch. The coronation of Mary is represented on the tympanum. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/1404206561&quot;&gt;A Virgin with Child&lt;/a&gt; decorates the trumeau.

The interesting ribs are underlined with red strips with golden L. The vaults are covered with fleur de lys gilded on a royal blue and golden Castilian castles on a red, symbolizing Saint Louis and his mother, Blanche de Castille. The walls are decorated with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/1404132095&quot;&gt;trefoil arcades between which twelve medallions are placed representing the apostles&lt;/a&gt;.

A personal undertaking of King Louis IX, it was built to house the relics of Christ's passion, notably the Crown of Thorns, Image of Edessa and a piece of the True Cross. Louis IX purchased the crown and other relics from Emperor Baldwin II in 1939 for the exorbitant sum of 135,000 livres. He added further relics from the Byzantium in 1941 and 1943. By contrast, the entire chapel cost 40,000 livres. A masterpiece of the rayonnate period of Gothic architecture, Sainte-Chapelle is not directly credited to any designer-builder. However, Louis IX's architect, Pierre de Montereau (or Pierre de Montreuil), who had rebuilt the apse of the Royal Abbey of Saint-Denis and completed the façade of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, is usually attributed to its design. Perceived as a symbol of monarchy and religion, the Sainte-Chapelle suffered considerable damage as a result of the French Revolution. The steeple and baldachin were removed, the holy relics were scattered, and various reliquaries, including the grande châsse, were melted down. Most of the statues were saved by Alexandre Lenoir. Under the auspices of Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc, significant restoration work was undertaken by the architects Félix Duban from 1836-1848, Jean Baptiste Lassus from 1848 to 1857, and Emile Boeswillwald, from 1858 to 1868. While some of the relics were never to be found again, others are today kept in the treasure of Notre-Dame Cathedral and at the National Library. The Royal Chapel, or Upper Chapel, for the king's use and the display of the relics, was dedicated by the papal legate and connected to the aula, or the main council room. It rests upon a Lower Chapel which was served as parish church for all the inhabitants of the palace and dedicated to the Virgin Mary by the Archbishop of Bourges. The Lower Chapel is located underneath a porch.

A personal undertaking of King Louis IX, it was built to house the relics of Christ's passion, notably the Crown of Thorns, Image of Edessa and a piece of the True Cross.

A personal undertaking of King Louis IX, it was built to house the relics of Christ's passion, notably the Crown of Thorns, Image of Edessa and a piece of the True Cross. Louis IX purchased the crown and other relics from Emperor Baldwin II in 1939 for the exorbitant sum of 135,000 livres. He added further relics from the Byzantium in 1941 and 1943. By contrast, the entire chapel cost 40,000 livres. A masterpiece of the rayonnate period of Gothic architecture, Sainte-Chapelle is not directly credited to any designer-builder. However, Louis IX's architect, Pierre de Montereau (or Pierre de Montreuil), who had rebuilt the apse of the Royal Abbey of Saint-Denis and completed the façade of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, is usually attributed to its design. Perceived as a symbol of monarchy and religion, the Sainte-Chapelle suffered considerable damage as a result of the French Revolution. The steeple and baldachin were removed, the holy relics were scattered, and various reliquaries, including the grande châsse, were melted down. Most of the statues were saved by Alexandre Lenoir. Under the auspices of Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc, significant restoration work was undertaken by the architects Félix Duban from 1836-1848, Jean Baptiste Lassus from 1848 to 1857, and Emile Boeswillwald, from 1858 to 1868. While some of the relics were never to be found again, others are today kept in the treasure of Notre-Dame Cathedral and at the National Library. The Royal Chapel, or Upper Chapel, for the king's use and the display of the relics, was dedicated by the papal legate and connected to the aula, or the main council room. It rests upon a Lower Chapel which was served as parish church for all the inhabitants of the palace and dedicated to the Virgin Mary by the Archbishop of Bourges. The Lower Chapel is located underneath a porch. The coronation of Mary is represented on the tympanum. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/1404206561&quot;&gt;A Virgin with Child&lt;/a&gt; decorates the trumeau. Its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/1405014000&quot;&gt;choir&lt;/a&gt; is made of a seven section hemicycle, enabling it to support the floor of the upper chapel. The interesting ribs are underlined with red strips with golden L. The vaults are covered with fleur de lys gilded on a royal blue and golden Castilian castles on a red, symbolizing Saint Louis and his mother, Blanche de Castille. The walls are decorated with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/1404132095&quot;&gt;trefoil arcades between which twelve medallions are placed representing the apostles&lt;/a&gt;. The Upper Chapel is similarly protected by a porch, whose &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/1404263091&quot;&gt;tympanum represents the Last Judgment&lt;/a&gt;. It has four bays and a seven section choir. La Sainte-Chapelle owes much of its fame to the upper chapel's stained glass windows--6,458 sq. ft of glass, two thirds of which are original, surrounded by delicate painted stonework. Each of the fifteen windows, measuring 15.4 meters tall and 4.25 meters wide, is divided into lancets, which when read from left to right, working from the bottom up, tell the biblical story of mankind beginning on the northside with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/1404144035&quot;&gt;Genesis&lt;/a&gt; and various other books of the Old Testament, continuing with the Passion of Christ, in the central choir, and ending with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/1404135885&quot;&gt;history relics&lt;/a&gt; on the south side. A flamboyantly gothic 16th century &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/1405025848&quot;&gt;rose window&lt;/a&gt; shows the Apocalypse around an enthroned Christ in the central oculus. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/1405027258&quot;&gt;Statues of the apostles&lt;/a&gt; stand on each side of the nave.

<photo  date_taken="2009-03-26 01:55:20" description="St Chappelle is a gorgeous chapel situated in the middle of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%8ele_de_la_Cit%c3%a9&quot;&gt;Ille de la Cité&lt;/a&gt; which had the very first settlement in Paris. It was constructed around the 12th century in the courtyard of the royal palace in the island. It is a great example of the Gothic style of architecture and was constructed with its skeleton on the outside, to support the two levels in this beautiful chapel. The lower chapel is dedicated to the Virgin Mary (below) and was for the palace parish. The Royal Chapel, constructed for the king and royal subjects, is more grand and charismatic. Its tall columns interespersed with intricate stained glass work allow for a better play of light in its vast open interior. Thus, the most remarkable aspect of this chapel is the stained glass work covering about 600sq. m., with over two-thirds being original peieces. Each of those panels tells a different story. Quote from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/Cathedrals/Paris/Sainte-Chapelle.shtml&quot;&gt;Discover France&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Reds and blues are the dominant colors, in contrast with the 15th century western rose window. In these panes the full biblical story of humanity is recounted, from the Creation to redemption through Christ; Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Judges, Isaiah, the Tree of Jesse, Saint John the Baptist, Daniel, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Tobias, Judith and Job, Esther, the Book of Kings, and the History of the Relics follow one to the next. Each window, divided into arches, reads from left to right and from top to bottom.&lt;/i&gt; If your eyes are sharp enough, there is one panel depicting crucification as well. Look below for shots of the lower chapel and detailed stained glass work. The particular day was really cloudy and really not the best time for shooting church interiors (sadly, tripods are not allowed either :( ). So I had to make do with what I got.
