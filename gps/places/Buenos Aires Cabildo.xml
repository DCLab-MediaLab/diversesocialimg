While the modern plaza took its form in 1884, its origins trace back to the early foundation of the city in 1580 when Juan de Garay planned a never built central plaza. In 1608, Jesuit clergymen secured a title to the property where Gar. In 1661 the local governor purchased the eastern half, which soon became the Plaza de Armas or Plaza del Fuerte. In 1804, the colonial government built Recova Vieja, a north-south Romanesque colonnade, which would soon become the plaza's market and created Plaza de la Victoria to the west. The area continued mostly unchanged until 1884, with only minor modifications including the addition of 1811 addition of La Pirámide de Mayo, when Mayor Torcuato de Alvear ordered the demolition of the colonnade, creating the current landscape." id="7756280532" latitude="-34.608534" license="3" longitude="-58.372867" nbComments="0" rank="12" tags="plazademay plaque park monserrat buenosaires ciudadautónomadebuenosaires ciudadautonomadebuenosaires argentina southamerica" title="Buenos Aires - Monserrat: Plaza de Mayo" url_b="http://static.flickr.com/8289/7756280532_99b5256e25_b.jpg" username="wallyg" views="29" />

<photo  date_taken="2012-07-22 18:48:52" description="La Pirámide de Mayo (May Pyramid), is the oldest national monument in the City of Buenos Aires was inaugurated on May 25, 1811 in in Plaza de Mayo. Its construction was by the Primera Junta to celebrate the first anniversary of the la Revolución de Mayo. By 1856, the monument had begun to deteriorate, and, under the direction of painter and architect Prilidiano Pueyrredón, ist was reconstructed. The old monument was covered in brick and masonry and used as a foundation. A 3.6 meter tall allegorical statue of Liberty crowned with a Phrygian cap created by French sculptor Joseph Dubourdieu was added to the crown. Dubourdieu also created four other allegorical sculptures for the four corners of the pedestal. The eastern face of the obelisk was adorned with a golden sun facing Casa Rosada, and the remaining three sides were decorated with crowns of laurels in alto-relievo. The original pedestal and capital were increased in height and breadth, with each of the four sides adorned with the national arms. A new fence was constructed with a gaslight placed at each corner. From the ground to the peak of the statue's Phrygian cap, the Pyramid now measured 18.76 metres. In 1859, as the plaster began to deteriorate, the base was refaced in marble. In 1873, Dubourdieu's stucco and terracotta statues began to decay and were replaced with four marble statues from the first floor of Banco Provincia. In 1912, the marble statues were removed (and later &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/search/?ss=2&amp;amp;w=70323761@N00&amp;amp;q=josephdubordieu+plazoletadesanfrancisco&amp;amp;m=text&quot;&gt;installed in Plazoleta de San San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;) and the pyramid was moved 63 meters to the east as part of an unmaterialized plan to surround it with a larger, grander monument. Instead, the foundation was repainted, the arms were restored to their 1813 condition , and the original railing was restored. On the west side of the Pyramid is a bronze plaque, added in 1891 during the Presidency of Carlos Pelligrini, that recognizes the first two military officers to lose their lives in the cause of Argentine Independence--Manuel Artigas and Felipe Pereyra de Lucena.
